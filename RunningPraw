The code has been modularized and template files for conceptual ease.

I also want a workspace where I can do client work, or develop new branches
of the parch code.

In order to achieve these two goals, I changed the folder structure, as follows:

PRAW
  /PRAW_Tools
    /ParchCodeBase
      => All the code base files live here
    /Templates
       -input.txt
       -codetemplates
       -config.txt
       - various headers/footers for outputwriters
    /WorkArea
      /Various Projects
 - newproj.sh

Because project work, CodeBase, Templates are all nested
at different levels, it can be difficult to setup a new working folder. At the top
level of the PRAW_Tools folder, a shell script (newproj.sh) has been written to
set up the correct folder structure:

/WorkArea
   /<PROJECTNAME>
      /<OUTPUTFOLDER>
      -- input.txt
      -- config.txt
      -- pstart.py

THe shellscript takes the following options on command line, and is run as follows:

./newproj.sh <PROJECTNAME> <OUTPUTFOLDER>

After this is done, remember to populate the input.txt file (if used).
Also, look at the config.txt carefully, to make sure the right options have been
chosen.

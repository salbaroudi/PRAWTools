99jyaa;Doxmiplz;1535023738.0;"&#x200B;This is a oft requested story from co-workers and friends alike, I present " Dinosaur Stretch" or " No poop in the champagne room". I remember it was during the witching hours of 2 a.m and 4 a.m, the place a semi ok nursing home some where in Chatsworth CA. The chief complaint was constipation, of course this had been going on for about a few weeks but now he NEEDS TO GET TO THE NOT SO CLOSEST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT NOW AT 3 A.M. Find the dude with his fellow swinging bachelor dudes, old as fuck (that is saying a lot considered the average age of my patients was probably 75), majorly contracted (legs and arms pulled in tightly to the torso) and basically in permanent nap mode ( again a pretty common occurrence). This is a milk and run, and wouldn't have bothered me if I was dying of sleep deprivation ( normal). &#x200B;Dude also had gnarled feet and toenail that had grown to a Velicoraptor like claw. Load him up and begin the 15 minute trip. All is well.&#x200B;Arrive at the hospital in Mission Hills, the Emergency Department is predictable saturated. Triage Nurse see us wheeling in our guy, rage of a thousand suns glinting in her eye as she gesstures us to the "wall".&#x200B;We called it holding the wall, there were no beds for our patient. So now we wait. Catch up some paperwork. 20- 30 minutes go by, patient is stable, trying to stay awake when suddenly our patient stirs. He lifts he wizened head up just to let out a dinosaur like screeeeee! and stretch his right leg with it's magnificent Raptor claw out away from his torso. With a popping noise eerily similar to that of a champagne cork being popped, weeks of shit comes flowing out. It was a lahar of pooh, and the resulting shrieks and commotion of everyone trying to evacuate the danger zone was quite loud. This drew the triage nurse into the hallway, looking at me " What happened! What is he for!" pointing at my patient now dreaming away with an almost rogue like grin now on his face. It was quite a feat to keep a straight face " Well we were here for constipation but.....""

e4pc70u;Doxmiplz;1535073182.0;"The same way you clean up a shitty baby, but with more towels and mop. Basically just a bigger and smellier shitty baby. Now one time I had to transport a guy so fat that he couldn't walk and would wipe his ass with hospital bed sheets, that is several orders of magnitude shittier than just cleaning up old dude shit."

e4pd9lc;m1serablist;1535074055.0;"Jesus fuck. I have a similar story, boogie on YouTube told this on a podcast. Apparently this one fatass guy would jerk off and cum in his folds just before his caretaker's visit for cleaning. Some poor fuck would then have to clean fatass cum marinated in a fat guy's sweaty folds."

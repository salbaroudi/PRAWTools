e4llxos;GuyTallman;1534921189.0;"Debating someones race has to be one of the dumbest past times ever. It is like all that shit you see about how, "well tiger woods isn't a real "black" golfer he is actually half asain." Say you were in a car, driving down the highway, and you just passed a car with Tiger Woods in it. If someone asked you what the race of the cars driver was you would probably go off visual cues alone and just say, "dude was a black guy."&#x200B;Assuming his bad driving didn't out him as asian. "

e4lnlf9;yeahRIP;1534922808.0;"I remember seeing him argue in the comments for the old show that some Islamic terrorists weren't middle eastern because they were born in Europe. So I guess being born to middle eastern parents, have middle eastern names, practicing a middle eastern religion, and killing in the name of that religion's god doesn't matter if you weren't born there. There's just no such thing as culture carried over from the old country. Chinatown? Bunch of fakers, it's all fucking Americans there. Little Italy? Didn't see a single fucking Italian there."

e4m7wla;wauterboi;1534944508.0;"Arguing about someone's race in itself makes race more important than it really is. Maddox arguing that there is a criteria for fitting a race is racist.Also, he didn't really even need to make an argument about whether Dick was racist or not - he can still be racist while also being a part of the race he's discriminating against. He can still judge others based on their race. Maddox made himself look way more ignorant for no reason."

e4m2r0q;yeahRIP;1534938034.0;"I can't remember exactly how he worded it, it was a long time ago. I remember he got fucking roasted for it in the comments, though. My big problem with it is that while it's technically right, it's kind of misleading. It's like a white guy moving from South Africa to the US and calling himself African-American. It's not wrong, it's just kind of misleading to say it like that.>some Islamic terrorists aren't middle eastern in any way shape or form.Yeah, I  would guess as much. I forget which attack was being talked about that week but I remember a bunch of attacker names were being listed and they didn't exactly make you think "Yeah that's a European name".Anyway this is a lot of useless words to basically point out Maddox being autistic about nationalities. Makes me wonder if he ever argued with Asterios about not really being Greek because "Well you weren't born in Greece so you're an American""

e4o9p6b;MattOrchard;1535023781.0;"Like I said, I was being pedantic. I think you could argue technically being the most predominant religion in the region doesn't make it a middle eastern religion because there's nothing about Islam that's inherently representative of middle easterners. I'd refer to Buddhism as an "Eastern religion" though, so even I don't live up to that little technicality.It was just an after thought. The main reason I chimed in was it seemed like the OP might have been conflating Muslims with Middle Easterners. That really would have been stupid, and from memory was the shit Maddox was trying to pull back in the day - implying criticizing trends in the Muslim world is just stereotyping brown people. From OPs follow up it seems like that wasn't what they were getting at. "

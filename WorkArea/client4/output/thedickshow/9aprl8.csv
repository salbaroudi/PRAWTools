e4x5dk9;BOOM-KOPF;1535412452.0;"Okay so wait, not only is jiggle actually in the game, they're taking steps to make sure the tits react differently based on the clothing they're in?"
e4xtglv;backwards7ven;1535433167.0;"3pm. Sunday. The phone has been ringing on and off since nine. This time I pick it up.    “Derek, it's Tyler.”    I replace the telephone receiver in the cradle, roll over in bed and attempt to get back to sleep. A half hour later it rings again.    “Derek, just hear me out. Nobody understands tit physics like you do...”    Immediately I lose my temper.    “You think that's desirable, do you? Spending every waking moment mobbed by the mental image of bouncing tits, crowding out your thoughts. I can't even remember the face of my dead wife. Just the tits of the woman who killed her. She was playing with them while she was driving. She couldn't stop her SUV in time...”    “So make some money off of it. There's a new treatment for tit blindness in Switzerland. They feed you muesli in the Alps. It rebalances your brain chemistry. Maybe it will help you to see your wife again. The job I have in mind will more than pay for it.”    “Okay, what is it?”    “A new playable character. Double J cups. Biggest norks in the history of videogaming.”    “What are you pouring them into?”    “Some kind of flimsy renaissance fayre style bodice.”    “You're mad. they'll come flying loose and start clipping into the scenery, dragging down the frame rate as they go. The ambient jiggling alone will overheat the processor.”    “That's why we need you. That's why we need the tit wizard.”     The following morning I am flying business class over the Atlantic, heading for San Diego. One last job I tell myself then I am out. Even as I say these words, I know they are not true.   "
e4x8evu;Qayden;1535415169.0;"They released the last game as a free2play where you paid real money for costumes, extra characters, etc. When I heard about this "less sexualization in DOA6" I immediately thought "you're just preparing to be able to sell the sexy costumes separately"."
e4x5zof;lazierbeam;1535413007.0;"I thought they were going for less-revealing outfits because of "esports" PR bullshit, but that could be offset by a more advanced jiggle engine.  I'm not optimistic though, even Dick himself has said "it's not the best fighting game," all it had to do for its success was continue filling its niche as the fanservice tiddy game, but they still want it to be a serious fighting game.  It even had a whole exhibition at EVO this month, did anyone even give a shit?  Probably not because no tiddies.  Also,>I see. New Engine, huh.Sam Hyde vs DOA crossover confirmed"
e4xekvz;Shmoode;1535420531.0;"Who even plays DOA. Tekken is clearly the supperior 3D fighting game franchise"

e4xuyxj;Wildcyote;1535434502.0;"No one can catch up with this technology"
e4yixiz;sweetb00bs;1535460059.0;"is the new tekken or street fighter worth buying for the jiggles?"
e4xbl78;t0mRiddl3;1535417928.0;"That sounds like a day one purchase then"
e4ybav8;CivilBindle;1535451100.0;"Dedication to the craft."

e4ymcdc;BigDumbRobot;1535465598.0;"Truly underappreciated post."
e4xb61m;Lpup;1535417569.0;"pretty much."
e4x7n7p;BenadrylPeppers;1535414476.0;"Soul Calibur or bust. Fight me.Seriously though, DOA has always felt so clunky and weird. I'm not sure why it has so reverence."
e4xhghc;elvenmonk;1535422974.0;"I feel like the only person who likes SR for the story.Don't forget the SRK massage game for switch: https://youtu.be/xUF7stduXZs"
e4z0myo;myyearinvagina;1535490832.0;"The new Street Fighter has such terrible load times it doesn't even matter how hot the babes are. I try and play it and in about 20 minutes I can only get 3 or 4 matches in because of the load times. "
e4xbuic;myyearinvagina;1535418152.0;"I pre-oredered. "
e4xim05;plazyx1;1535424055.0;"The busts in soul calibur are great too."
e4xe64d;callofthedeep;1535420177.0;"Soul Calibur is terrific but I've always loved DoA, I'll take it over Tekken or Street Fighter any day of the week tbh."
e4xafth;radiodialdeath;1535416941.0;"Fellow Soul Calibur guy here. DOA has always felt clunky to me as well. "
e4xb3sg;Lpup;1535417516.0;"Tekken > Soul Calibur > DOADOA is way too reliant on counters and reversals so it doesn't play very smooth"
e4y15fm;No_Nuts;1535440625.0;"I pre-cummed."
e4xhcae;elvenmonk;1535422873.0;"I would if I liked the combat. Though this one is supposed to revamp the mechanics"
e4xun05;avnavar;1535434205.0;"Ivy has top cans"
e4xrp6l;BenadrylPeppers;1535431685.0;"Voldo. Enough said."
e4xs6ci;elvenmonk;1535432074.0;"The new one is supposed to change the mechanics. Also, you forgot virtual fighter"
e4yjxi5;biobb36;1535461549.0;"The reversals in DOA are excellent in my opinion. They're pretty much the only way to keep a player engaged even while they're being hit, they add another element of the fighting game RPS mindgame to each player, and they give players a legitimate reason to know multiple combo routes from the same starter. Most characters also have lower damage combo options that aren't reversable after the first hit or two.I also find DOA to be the most fluid of the 3D fighters, or at least on par with Soul Calibur in that regard. Virtua Fighter trails them somewhat (though I think VF5FR is still the best 3D fighter to date) , and then Tekken feels like your character is wearing cement shoes. I'll never understand people complaining about the lack of fluidity in DOA, when Tekken exists.Ban Lpup"
e502blh;elvenmonk;1535523850.0;"You need to play melty. There if you tap on beat to your opponent's hits it cuts the damage down. If you miss it increases the damage"
e50b5qw;biobb36;1535532302.0;"I do, actually! Not a ton but I've put in a good 20-30 hours in with some friends on the ccaster netplay version. It's a fun game, but pressure resets are so free that it gives me a lot of bad habits in the games I try to take more seriously. Do you play it quite a bit?"

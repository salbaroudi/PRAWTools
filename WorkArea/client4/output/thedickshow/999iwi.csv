999iwi;stevey_pizza;1534933848.0;Does anyone else think Maddox is screwing up his own voting?
999iwi;stevey_pizza;1534933848.0;"I think hes deliberately broken it at 50% to ruin our voting"

e4m0uhc;SnakeJerusalem;1534936073.0;"I think [this thread from a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDickShow/comments/98du4x/in_case_their_was_any_doubt_in_your_mind/) already made it abundantly clear he was indeed crippling his own voting system to prevent fuckery from us. I don't get how not even Dick takes it into consideration."
e4m9ia5;NumberEightySeven;1534947035.0;"He's definitely fucking with it. A few hours ago. Cuck Sockers had 500+ votes and Hazencruz had 300+ votes, now it's the other way around."
e4lz6ie;tefloncondom;1534934379.0;"I'm wondering about that number myself. I was almost thinking a 1337 kind of code? But 571972 = "stiptz" is the most I can make out of that.Anyone else more versed in this cryptic language care to take a stab?"
e4m4y91;personn5;1534940597.0;"Are you trying to tell me Maddox, the guy who lies about people online, who thinks fans are just property, would disrespect his fans and just mess with the voting to get the results he wants? Say it isn't so"
e4mt6no;wolfbadger69;1534977295.0;"Doesnâ€™t Maddox review the votes from last week each episode? What did he say on 114 about voting? (Not gonna listen)"
e4m53jz;Tamrowski;1534940781.0;"The voting looks like its back to normal for me, currently on my phone. I don't see the weird numbers "
e4mng49;Qayden;1534971651.0;"Dick immediately reacted with declaring both winners, so if that's the case it backfired."
e4lyzaj;Grand_Admiral_C;1534934171.0;"That would be downright rude of him. Almost as rude as ending a successful podcast without a single mention of your stalwart cohost..."
e4maokn;AlexWyvern;1534949137.0;"Of course he takes it into consideration. It's the whole idea."
e4mptpf;A_Level_126;1534974119.0;"Of course hes considered it but it's funny to keep saying it's because his website sucks. It also prevents Maddox from getting any satisfaction because if you're too autistic to realize it then maddox would be too for sure "
e4o92bq;BenadrylPeppers;1535023076.0;"The idea is to fuck with it. That's it."
e4m9kz7;patomanofallcolors;1534947164.0;"Thats what I noticed toomight have to have two winners again"
e4m0r0i;tefloncondom;1534935976.0;"He could also be trying to spell the word "stupid" but it's a real stretch."
e4m2859;pagoos;1534937466.0;"I think he just mashed random keys tbh"
e4mlf00;Mrfish31;1534969252.0;"Most recent goss is the "hacker" going by 571972 which is almost certainly a false flag attack from Maddox to claim that he can't go on any longer/drum up support against Dick. The fact he nuked the voting himself basically proves it. "
e4ms51r;tronfonne;1534976337.0;"It's probably just the max amount of votes his piece of shit website would allow"
e4n2jj5;Teddybearsyrup;1534985087.0;"no acknowledgement at all"
e4oa53u;CastlePokemetroid;1535024289.0;"Doesn't that mean that he's doing our job for us, then?"
e4oabqd;BenadrylPeppers;1535024502.0;"Yup. He thinks he's being S-M-R-T but really, he played himself."

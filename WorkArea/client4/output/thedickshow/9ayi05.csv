9ayi05;HoneybadgerLiberty;1535488284.0;"I know this a long shot but I found a few Dickheads who play OSRS on Facebook, so I'm extending the search to Reddit. For anyone interested, please add "Horse Cahk.""

e4z3yye;soberum;1535494208.0;"I actually just tried that today looking for that good old nostalgia hit, I'll add you sometime when I have time to play again."
e4z45kl;MomentOfXen;1535494381.0;"My first forum experience was running a Runescape black market forum when I was like, 12. Good times. If I could get my old main account into the OSRS world I may pick it up but like hell I am starting over."
e4zdi51;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1535502633.0;"Start a Clan.&#x200B;My ign is ErbBetaPat"
e4zflet;deskrod;1535504382.0;"Hey man, I’m deskrod in game I’ll add you next time I’m online "
e4zgekx;Feelinggood11;1535505088.0;"Also if any Dick heads wanna get in on this, it's F2P but Amazon Prime gets you a free month of premium membership as well. "
e4zt5gw;Wildcyote;1535515832.0;"Same as my Reddit name, Ironman BTW"
e4zyltm;Spacemangspiff;1535520473.0;"I only pk with pures"
e5064gg;SGDove;1535527397.0;"I play rs3- IGN: Tilup. Ironman btw."
e4z6a1c;HoneybadgerLiberty;1535496345.0;"Great! I got about 3 other dickheads on there. I will help you get started if you need a boost or tips."
e4z6bub;HoneybadgerLiberty;1535496392.0;"Starting over does suck but you can create an account build you like, I guess.That forum sounds interesting hahaha"
e506b5i;SGDove;1535527576.0;"You can continue from rs3 which has a smaller community but better endgame content or you can start over with OSRS which is better in that it's just solid 2007 Runescape with a few additions which are all polled by players before they get added. A lot of people prefer osrs but if you like Diablo or Path of Exile rs3 all the way."
e50aiy8;soberum;1535531686.0;"I had an account way back in the day, Runescape classic days, even before 2007scape. I do remember setting up a 2007 scape account at some point before 2010 but even with the email address and a password reset I can not access my account. As it turns out it's hard as fuck to get those old pre-2010 accounts back."
e4zdw6c;HoneybadgerLiberty;1535502962.0;"That's the plan! We're up to 5-7 dickheads now!"

e50a4of;soberum;1535531288.0;"Nice, I dmed you my name but if you're anything like me you probably never check messages. My ign is soberums, I know, real original eh."
e4zua6y;MomentOfXen;1535516784.0;"I miss that place, its weird Gossamer based platform, inactive administrator and inter-forum rivalries were great. "
e50dnpp;MomentOfXen;1535534677.0;"Ive got a pretty decent off RS3 account but I would only want to play os. :("
e4zgftg;deskrod;1535505119.0;"Sounds good! Got shit stats but I’m just there to have fun "
e4zgow3;HoneybadgerLiberty;1535505343.0;"Im more of a skiller myself with average combat skills so i am trash as far as osrs community goes too lol"
e4zh94y;deskrod;1535505829.0;"Well if the community is concerned every non-maxed account is trash "

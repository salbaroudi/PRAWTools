e4ygm01;datt_toke;1535457052.0;"wtf all the anti semitic shit in comments, is this a new klan rally youtuber "
e4xja6w;PolygoraNetwork;1535424663.0;"Not watching a Metokur video, he's an unfunny faggot. But what I've gleaned from all these mass shootings is maybe americans should stop bullying weird kids with guns"

e4xnt2u;InsanityKeep;1535428491.0;"He's supposed to be funny? I find the videos just get to the meat of issues and most people can't chew on it."
e4xkpe8;grimster;1535425911.0;"Half of Metokur's entertainment value comes from his content, the other half from the teary-eyed soychuggers who call him an unfunny faggot on reddit."
e4xt0u2;avnavar;1535432787.0;"We don't take too kindly to wrongthink 'round these parts"
e50cwtg;SneakyMcGeee;1535533975.0;"I cannot fucking stand him. He sounds like he is in a constant state of smugness. Every word begins with a pause, every statement is a rhetorical question, as if he is sucking on a real sour dick and about to giggle at his own fucking shit. Hate this kiwifarms/ encyclopedia dramatica shit that the show has become. We went from a show about a guy talking about manly things to fucking chris chan and mundane matt every week."
e4y2acf;BobJWHenderson;1535441793.0;"lol the dickfags are in full force with the downvotes. Metokur is just like Larry: an unfunny, uninteresting dude with a cool voice. "
e4xpfg9;PolygoraNetwork;1535429820.0;"I am aware"
e4xrtxw;BenadrylPeppers;1535431794.0;"Right? All he does is put out the information and sometimes laugh while he's talking because most of the shit he covers is just ludicrous.Humour is subjective anyway! Facts aren't!"
e4xtcml;OmegaEinhorn;1535433068.0;"Indeed. He's rarely jokey - unless you count that weird voice he sometimes makes.His talent is cherry-picking stupid and funny shit others say."
e4xpesu;PolygoraNetwork;1535429806.0;"Yes, I chug soy because I don't think Mr Redditeur makes worthwhile content, a soyboy is someone who holds a different opinion on your favourite eceleb"

e4y9egq;KarlOskar12;1535449185.0;"Larry tries to make comedy, Metokur just tries to make fun of people."

e4xv9zx;BenadrylPeppers;1535434785.0;"You could post some Pizza The Hut, that can only go over well."
e4yb0n3;BobJWHenderson;1535450815.0;"I can't be critical of the show and be a dickhead?  Why don't you fuck off to r/gatekeeping, faggot."
e4ymk3v;PolygoraNetwork;1535465980.0;"What does disliking Metokur have to do with disliking Dick?"
e4yazow;BobJWHenderson;1535450789.0;"Yeah, and they're both terrible at it.  Plus Larry's a fucking boomer. "
e4ymiiu;PolygoraNetwork;1535465903.0;"Minority opinions aren't "incorrect", or do you think like the majority of normalfags that the "correct" opinion on the Internet is that government should be able to control who can use it and which sites are allowed to be active or not at will"
e4yccmc;Spacemangspiff;1535452218.0;"Why would you consume media that bothers you regularly....you faggot "
e4ymnec;Spacemangspiff;1535466147.0;"He called people dickfags.  Just like Tito dr nurse and Maddox. I could give a fuck about metokur."
e4ytfn0;A_Level_126;1535480540.0;"There is no objective answer to your hypothetical scenario, so in that scenario yes there is no incorrect opinion. To call someone unfunny when you know most people disagree means you're objectively wrong. "
e4ytzxw;1WCW;1535481651.0;"I know I'm stepping on a landmine here, but honestly most people should consume media that bothers them, instead of hand-picking their reality by only consuming media that confirms their bias for them."
e4ywqsv;PolygoraNetwork;1535486147.0;"That does not fit the definition of "objective"."
e4yu4zw;Spacemangspiff;1535481916.0;"We’re talking about a comedy podcast.  If you don’t like watching a certain tv show, you don’t watch it If you don’t like nickleback, don’t buy their fucking albums If you don’t like marshmallows, don’t buy mallow cups. I’m not saying build an echo chamber, but why bash your head against the wall with a leisure activity?"
e4yub4z;1WCW;1535482235.0;"I don't know, I like to think of TDS as a little more than a "comedy podcast". I think that it tackles issues from a different perspective than what I'm used to. I'm a pretty liberal guy, but one thing I like about TDS, is most people on the show, and in this subreddit, see the world in a different way than me and I get to experience it in a way that is funny. It's like a bizarro world Daily Show. I also used to listen to No Agenda, which is even more "news of the day" focused, from two guys who see the world completely different from me, but it opened my eyes to a different perspective. I certainly find more value in listening to conservative talk points about issues than listening to the same liberal cirlcejerk that most other media contributes."
e4yudt7;Spacemangspiff;1535482371.0;"I agree.  The dude used rhetoric that made it sound like Tito/DrNurseFancyLady/etc, and I honestly wonder why they continue to listen so voraciously.  That was my main focus "
e4yugif;1WCW;1535482505.0;"Oh gotcha. He probably thinks he's "doing research on the enemy" or some dumb shit. "

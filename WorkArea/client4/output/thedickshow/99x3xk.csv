99x3xk;chronus_poo;1535143556.0;"I don't know why this bugs me, but Elon Musk saying he works 120 hours a week. First off, no he doesn't. That would leave him less than 7 hours a day to sleep, shower, shit, jerk off, shave, eat, break federal law on twitter, and so forth. And what is a 120 hour workweek supposed to prove? Dude sounds like Maddox. You're not a timesheet producer. You're a car producer. Learn to delegate."

e4r9ks7;sheetskees;1535152711.0;""You broke Reddit."No I didn't you fuck. Your shit website won't load. Me entering 'reddit.com' into my browser did not break your fucking website. Don't blame me for your inability to be a fucking website."
e4r5pow;backwards7ven;1535149353.0;"Whenever I visit the Egyptian rooms in the British Museum the mummies are never doing anything. I have never witnessed one beating their moldering bandaged fists against the inside of their display case; strangling one of the curators, while museum security guards attempt to prise apart its freakishly strong death grip; eating from the feeding bowls of fruit and vegetables that are left out for them; or even attempting to masturbate. They just lie on their backs all day and refuse to respond, no matter hard you bang on the glass. I am beginning to come round to the idea that the reputation of mummies and their curses is undeserved. Fuck anyone who tells me that the climate in the UK is unsuitable for them. If you cant cope with the English weather put on a jumper. Wear an anorak. Do something, anything, you lazy deadbeat ancient Egyptian fucks. "

My girlfriend and I were going to the movies, as we're leaving home I see her grabbing one of those denim jackets that only go halfway to the middle of her torso and I warn her "baby, I know you, you're gonna be cold, it's chill outside". She just dismisses me like I'm a fucking retard. Of course as soon as I park the fucking car and she steps outside she's got those bambi eyes and she's saying "oops i guess you were right". NO FUCKING SHIT. THIS IS THE LAST TIME YOU GET MY JACKET YOU IDIOT!"
e4r3sjf;sirjaimes;1535147542.0;"Shitty stoplights. The last stoplight I have to drive through to get to work regularly skips my green. It’s gotten so frustrating I pull a right-turn, U-turn, right-turn to get through."

e4r6ot4;EZMickey;1535150230.0;"People who really want to be acknowledged for reading books by filling their social media with posts like "Some of my best friends are fictional characters" or "I'd rather spend a Friday night reading than going out drinking". It's not the reading, it's the societal perception that this form of escapism is somehow nobler than others and the need to brag about it.  You know who else read a lot? Osama Bin Laden. "

Come on, it's just $20!"No. I'm 24, barely making ends meet, trying to save up to go back to school and my dream of someday owning a home before I'm 50 is slowly fading away. Fuck off and die. "
e4r1193;DoctorMadcow;1535144600.0;"People that constantly say "Money can't buy happiness" or "You know, studies find that most wealthy people are unhappy."&#x200B;Shut up. Money can solve literally every problem in the world. It's the most beautiful thing that exists, and can quite literally buy happiness. You can bang hookers on a yacht, or buy a working jet pack. Why would a wealthy man ever be sad? Does Trump look sad? Does Jordan Belfort look sad? Is Scrooge McDuck sad when he swims in his pool of cash? Money can buy freedom from work, travel, possessions, friends, status, everything anyone could ever want. I assume that "Money can't buy happiness" is just a myth that poor people tell themselves to feel less inadequate. "
e4r3p6p;BrassHockey;1535147451.0;"When people bypass the commonly understood term in favor of the more "academic" term to lord their "intelligence" over you. I saw a facebook post that went something like "Great! My kids just got over their Pertussis and now they have Coxsackie Virus! Will the maladies ever abate?"

I guess I could take it back and tell the chef to make a hamburger with cheese..."How the fuck is that not what cheeseburger means?"
e4rah0h;TheLeastCreative;1535153470.0;"People that show sarcastic interest in what you are talking about, and say things like "cool story"I can never tell if I am being annoying or if they are just being boring. As an autismo it's basically a coin toss. Honestly I would rather have someone just tell me to shut up and fuck off. That would offend me less"

e4rozw9;plazyx1;1535165645.0;"That idiotic "paradox of tolerance" comic.Speech isn't an action. Nobody dies when someone says some abhorrent shit. Nobody ever caught a stray word, and had to go through physical therapy.Meet words with words. This chickenshit ideal that people need to meet words with violence has only caught on because the people spewing that shit have shitty ideas that nobody really wants once you've articulated it."

I hate both, but I haven't gone in years so I decided I would and I can't get anything for with 3 months because they are all booked.  It makes total sense to me now hour cancer gets to stage 4. And it's because theses asshole are busy dealing with people who fill themselves with butter everyday, and other avoidable problems to deal with people with real problems.And the few options they give you for dates are always in the middle of the week and in the middle of the day. I'm not going to take a precious day off so I can see some asshole who I don't even like. I don't even take days off for people I do like most of the time. "

e4r13ih;AllahHatesFags;1535144672.0;"Laugh tracks or "studio audiences" in TV shows.  They really ruin a show for me because after every other line it feels like they are trying to tell me "This is funny, laugh at this!"  Fuck you, I'll decide if it's funny or not.  Two of my favorite sitcoms are *The Office* (US) and *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* and guess what, neither of them had a fucking laugh track because they let their comedy stand on it's own!  Who in the hell came up with this bullshit idea anyway?"

And lo and behold that is what ends up happening sometimes because of how low the lid of the toilet is.I don't know what the threshold is, but once you go past a certain point you might as well be using a southeast Asian, hole-in-the-floor-type toilets. And I'll be goddamned if I use one of those in my All-American household of goods manufactured in China, thank you very much!"
e4r8gje;No_Thot_Control;1535151756.0;"How much the PNW has become like California.

e4r1sdh;AllahHatesFags;1535145427.0;"I agree, it's just a stupid fucking platitude that poor people tell themselves so they will feel better about being broke as fuck and barely scraping by.  There are very few problems a person can have that can't be solved with enough money."
e4werb8;jahvidsanders44;1535371932.0;"Money buys happiness in that it shields you from financial stress and worries but there's a diminishing return after $70k-80k a year. After that point you're usually good for most things that happen to you but after that you have to start worrying about securing your money."
e4rds4j;boedo;1535156248.0;"There are plenty of depressed rich people in the world and there are even more happy poor people. What “money doesn’t buy happiness” means to me is that unless you have a fulfilling life, with people who love you and who you love, you can’t be happy no matter how rich you get.You’re assuming that the acquisition of “stuff” makes people happy but it simply isn’t true, in fact some people have a lot of stuff and they don’t feel fulfilled because they always feel like they want more. Having a lot of money also creates problems - for one thing security. If you don’t have anything worth stealing you’re probably not going to get robbed, if you’re rich you will find plenty of people trying to rip you off. I’m not saying having money is a bad thing, it’s great, but you have to be able to be happy despite it or you’ll never be happy no matter how much you’ve got. "

e4s2wf2;chronus_poo;1535178243.0;"Aside from the last one of each, those two sets of sentiments are not incompatible. There are certainly unethical journalists, and freedom of the press is essential to a functioning democracy. Liberals are not currently saying that press regulation is bad. They are saying that the president should not single out individual outlets for criticizing him, and that he should not paint "the media" with a broad negative brush. If we regulate the press it must be done fairly, such as through the now dead FCC Fairness Doctrine. This is only hypocrisy if you oversimplify."

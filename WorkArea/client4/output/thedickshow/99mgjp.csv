e4p2gi3;MazInger-Z;1535064940.0;"Who's Digibro?"
e4qu88x;IkariRapeman;1535134662.0;"If you enjoy cringe/schadenfreude, the announcement trailer for the CR funded tumblr 'anime' in question is worth checking out. It comes across like a good parody of the calarts style 'progressive' garbage that's been all the rage as of late, but it's fucking real and it's catching a nuclear fuckton of shit which you'll have to look off youtube to find, on account of them disabling the like dislike ratio and comments because of course.

e4ppwhd;morzinbo;1535084388.0;"There's this one cuck that works for CR named Miles that makes it his life's mission to shit on people who pirate anime. I remember seeing him on the KissAnime sub shitting on people left and right. He was also trying to defend CR's actions when pirates found out that CR was severely downsampling their videos 24 hrs after they were posted, which meant that if you didn't watch the episode the day it came out you got an even shittier version than their webplayer already delivers."

e4w1sz6;the_pasemi;1535357469.0;"For real, and he can't handle being called one despite claiming to be shameless about his tastes.When he was pressed about it on a stream his explanation basically came down to "attraction doesn't count as paraphilia if the subject is fictional", which is just plain false. I like digi and have nothing against lolicon, which is why I hope he stops using it like a PC euphemism for pedophilia. I understand why he's desperate to get away from the stigma but that's not an excuse for being dishonest."
e4qvkvz;morzinbo;1535137165.0;"Does replying to someone asking for a way to hurt crunchyrolls revenue with the word HorribleSubs count as negative?"
e4qsndn;Pendacan;1535131354.0;"Why'd you ever switch to spotify when a folder filled with music you've been downloading since elementary school would suffice?"

e4pyio8;trulygenericname1;1535092081.0;"there's still better subgroups out there."
e4p8axx;BobJWHenderson;1535069991.0;"Which one was that?"
e4p604q;justchillouteveryone;1535067932.0;"It’s a youtube video of Dick interviewing him (though you still might not wanna play it if there are people around)"
e4qtn5i;IkariRapeman;1535133465.0;"Certainly this is the case fairly often. But not always.Quite honestly a lot of sub groups these days (commie for example) will take official subs and make them even worse, if they edit them much at all, unless you have such a boner for awful KFX and other tacky typesetting that it overrides all other metrics of quality. You have to work on a case by case basis, same for stream encodes vs TV rips - not all TV rips are better. On the other hand if a show's been out long enough, there's almost never any reason not to grab a good bluray.MyAnimeList may scream cancer, but the subgroup ratings on show pages are about the best you can do short of comparing the scripts yourself. If a sub is egregiously bad, you'll see it catch a lot of shit, just expect some level of hyperbole.In any case, I'll take people recommending horriblesubs rips wholesale over blind support of shitty players you have to pay for like CR (where the idea that your cash is going to support the Japanese industry is dubious at best) and pozzed ass stream sites like kissanime. There's no reason to stream on a PC at least."
e4q2kfa;Angel_Hunter_D;1535096314.0;"Are they easier to use?"
e4p8ht0;lago-m-orph;1535070149.0;"that we’re talking about cartoon drawings"
e4qii8t;trulygenericname1;1535113411.0;"roughly the same?"
e4qtqwo;IkariRapeman;1535133681.0;"Everything is on [nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si) or nyaa.pantsu, same as the torrents on horriblesubs' site.And animebytes if you're a real nigga."

e4pd8ya;lago-m-orph;1535074041.0;"Who died and made you the authority on this subject? People have their own way of interpreting things especially something as subjective as a tv show. Idiot. Looking at cartoons doesn't make you a pedophile."

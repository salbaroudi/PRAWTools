e4ow2bj;asteist;1535059024.0;"People used to pay disabled kids to come be part of their family at Disney so they could cut the lines  for rides.* It used to be that you could go in through the exit, cut the line, and sometimes even ride the ride two or three times in a row. Now it's basically a free fast pass. I think all you need is a note from a doctor saying you have a qualifying disability (You don't even need to specify what it is).\* I (blind) missed out on a lot of cash by not doing this for other families."

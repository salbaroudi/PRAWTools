98rs5z;Cancer-Cinema;1534781569.0;I Kinda Feel Bad For Little Platinum Books.
98rs5z;Cancer-Cinema;1534781569.0;"Ughh, I don't know guys, Little Platinum Books threw in with a loser, should we should be attacking them directly just for that?I kinda like the concept of the books, these guys just made the god awful mistake of associating with Saddox.They never directly attacked Dick like Mundane Matt did, or scammed their backers like those Indiana Jones Manpurse guys.Furious George deserves to be trolled mercilessly, and any people that he associates with should be filled in on the goss, and warned.But it feels like we are burning these guys at the stake for making a poor choice in an advertiser. I guess I'm soft, but I feel bad for these dudes who obviously put in a lot of work for a passion project, and now their whole project is basically torpedo'd because they made the mistake of being fans of Maddox, that's a shitty position to be in.I'm a huge fan of the dick show, I bought the shirt, and am a patreon, I just hope other dick heads at least try to offer these guys an olive branch instead of just hating on them for hanging out with the Armenian Babadook.Just my two cents..."

e4i9ifx;Spacemangspiff;1534782180.0;"I’ll give you that.   If you’ll notice not everyone is shitting on them. I believe he even offered to sponsor dicks show in a tweet and I don’t think he was being disingenuous Anyone who has a professional relationship with Maddox these days is probably entirely oblivious to the past 2 years of shenanigans.I’d be interested to know his thoughts after finding out "
e4i9k9z;tommy_twofeet;1534782291.0;"No one is "attacking" them at all. They are simply being informed as to the kind of person they are doing business with. It's not even entirely about fucking with Maddox. Anyone who gets conned by him deserves to know the truth whether they want to hear it or not. LPB doesn't want to listen to the warning sirens then what ever happens next is on them."
e4i9v0z;portuguese-charlie;1534782965.0;"You’re mostly right, which is why there is no attacking going on."
e4i9odb;smokecutter;1534782544.0;""Attacking" get raped.Seriously what do you mean by attacking? you can't use that word without any examples and leave that to my imagination, I've only seen some people making fun of a poor investment on an online forum, can I make fun of the guy who sold his apple shares? Or is that attacking as well? "
e4icpqj;Ben2749;1534789238.0;"For what it's worth, LPB may be the last sponsor Maddox gets. Now that he's lost the old feed, all of the good reviews and high listener numbers that carried over from BPitU are gone. He's going to look far less appealing to prospective advertisers/sponsors and potential guests."
e4ialtl;SlaveNo1213356;1534784655.0;"I like their concept but feel like the trend has passed unless they get more creative with it. I got my buddy and his wife the "Go the Fuck to Sleep" and "You Have to Fucking Eat" books when they had their kid a while back.You know, typing all of that out, I really hope they do succeed but get smarter about the people they sponsor, because those books were funny as fuck."
e4iln8s;Phteven_j;1534801848.0;"I don't personally have any sympathy for crowdfunders. If you are resorting to that to raise money for your business, I don't think you should be in business in the first place. I am sure they are decent guys and don't deserve our ire, but their business should fail.I built a buttplug empire with the sweat of my brow and god damn elbow grease. "
e4iev7y;Spork_Of_Doom;1534793209.0;">Ughh, I don't know guys, Little Platinum Books threw in with a loser, should we should be attacking them directly just for that?They doubled down when confronted with how shitty of a person Saddox is."
e4isu7s;LeviClay88;1534808585.0;"50-50If the guy was smart, he'd have listened to what he was told, cut ties with Saddox and come on the Dickshow to talk about it.It wouldn't have cost him a penny, we'd have got the goss, Saddox would be pissed... and his books would have got funded no sweat.If he can't see that... then he's as dumb as furious George"
e4ixc1c;Lpup;1534812461.0;"they already threw Maddox under the bus, Dick should invite them on the show and get their hot take on the Goss given they probably had no idea"
e4jl6j8;FireballWhiskey26;1534832921.0;"I agree.Here’s some ideas for their books:How To Kill Your BrandHow to Sue for 20 Million Dollars and LoseHow to Pose as a Female Reporter to get Former Friends Fired From Their Jobs"
e4iko1v;Fcuco;1534800780.0;"Why? All they got was more free publicity and exposure to a larger audience with disposable income. That guy is secretly celebrating the whole thing, the alternative was exposure to just that show, an audience of 3 or 4 clearly broke (and broken) people that barely engage, let alone spend money, on the show itself.Really makes me wonder if that guy played the long game and was counting on something like this."
e4ijp5n;JMC266;1534799725.0;"Their Kickstarter was going to fail regardless of getting caught up with the Dick/Maddox feud. All this did was give them free advertising to a whole other community."
DELETED;NoAuthor;-1;DELETED;
e4i9o4u;NumberEightySeven;1534782529.0;"I feel the same way. Their books actually seem pretty cool. They shouldn't be fucked with but they deserve to be informed what a scumbag Maddox is and how he lies about his download numbers. Most of them probably being automatic downloads from Biggest Problem listeners."
e4igl43;SneakyMcGeee;1534795800.0;"What you’re experiencing is empathy. Unfortunately, the dick show has thrown in with this gay mister metokum and kiwi ass farms shit. Sane people know what you mean by “attack” but these dudes are “just asking questions, bro!” they’ll keep on keeping on. Idiots, look up “attack”. To criticize or oppose fiercely and publicly.  They want to be cunts to people on the internet because their gay internet heroes who make 20 minute long videos on sjws are also cunts to people on the internet."
e4ib5tl;PersonMcGuy;1534785899.0;"To be fair if you're sponsoring a company you're explicitly supporting them and the onus is on you to ensure you're not sponsoring a horrible piece of shit. "
e4iouki;Jack-Browser;1534805008.0;"Have you tried wood polish instead of elbow grease?"
e4ir0zs;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534806989.0;"Dick is building his empire with crowdfunding...I think you've got a plug up your ass."
e4k5hf4;Cancer-Cinema;1534864793.0;"If they actually did that, I would legit give them $100.00 bones, fuck if they only did one of those I'd still give them $100.00!"
e4igu72;johnnysteen;1534796153.0;"Go gild yourself."
e4iqcvo;SnakeJerusalem;1534806395.0;"Jim and kiwi farms absolutely have a peanchent for being harsh towards lolcows and whoever sets off their bullshit detectors. I would even agree that they are not the sensitive type, and I get that people with higher level of empathy would not be fans of them.Having said that, there is a difference between calling people out on their bullshit / launghting at their stupidity, and being actual bullies -- and none of the people you mention are that."
e4iyz99;tommy_twofeet;1534813876.0;"Stop using this alt like a faggot. This is me attacking you because you're being a bitch.Ya know what? I agreed with you at some point because you made a good point and made an honest attempt at civil discourse no matter how many people shit on you....but now you're acting like whiny little baby. There is a difference between Dick heads talking shit to Maddox and informing people who have business relationships with him of his wrong-doings. "
e4ior0v;Jack-Browser;1534804915.0;"You sound like a gamerghazi subscriber."
e4iip4v;huctro;1534798551.0;"\#imwithhim"
e4iz2xk;Phteven_j;1534813962.0;"This is not crowdfunding IMO -- the content is free with premium upgrades available, but totally optional. Crowdfunding is people begging for money and giving a pittance in return. "
e4j3c12;SneakyMcGeee;1534817526.0;"That was before you all started hosting white supremacist and dick reached out to goddamn Richard spencer and Mister metokur and his shitty pause after every word to laugh at his own smugness infected the show. “And you see hmph dear viewer hmph what kind of person hmp hmp what kind of man if you will hmph hmph hmph a cuck if you will hmph hmph hmph hmph”"
e4j3ixh;SneakyMcGeee;1534817687.0;"You sound like the kind of person that fanatically follows gamerghazi for outrage. "
e4j5bel;tefloncondom;1534819197.0;"Pretty correct. There is an incentive with using Patreon, kickstarter and whatever else might as well be panhandling."
e4jxfng;DrewbieWanKenobie;1534852751.0;"Of course it's crowdfunding. Do you think the show would still be there and free if suddenly Dick was getting $0 a month?Well, he might turn to ads or something sure but in the meantime, it's crowdfunded.Yeah some people suck at Crowdfunding but there's also some great success stories out there."
e4kbzvk;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534878082.0;"If you're confused, here's a litmus test for crowdfunding: Does a crowd fund the show or do advertisers fund it?"
e4j73jy;tommy_twofeet;1534820710.0;"Do you listen to the show at all? Go fuck off then. "
e4j4rht;Jack-Browser;1534818723.0;"no thanks, too sad"
e4j5h59;Phteven_j;1534819334.0;"I always strive to be pretty correct :)I definitely feel that I am getting my money's worth with anyone I back on Patreon. Kickstarter feels like charity, especially since the end products are often wildly different from what has been promised. "
e4lghd8;tefloncondom;1534916161.0;"I equate patreon more with busking, whereas crowdfunding is sitting on a piece of cardboard holding out a little tin cup and promising to do something once you have enough for a guitar."

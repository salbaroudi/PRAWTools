9az7qq;alex_omul;1535494037.0;"I'm 45 minutes in (don't ask why) and so far they've only talked about farts... I'm not even joking. Quality podcast."

e4z4ob4;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535494869.0;"No."
e4z6vsz;Nirvana2081;1535496888.0;"Nope."
e4z8yvw;MatsuMuhou;1535498733.0;"Nay."
e4z7hr9;Deranged40;1535497432.0;"Nah"
e4zjqmh;chichirodriguez;1535507905.0;"So how frequently is he playing his dumbass fart sound effect?"
e4z5qj2;alex_omul;1535495846.0;"Maddox's answer from the Youtube comments section. He also liked his own comment.We've never had a topic like this before, and the guest was the perfect person to discuss it given his recent media exposure. When we do heavy or political topics, I get whiners complaining that the show is too serious, and when we do lighter topics like this, we get whiners saying it's too trivial. Ultimately we aim for balance and produce an entertaining show, which is why we include news, commentary, voicemail and debate. It's pretty much the perfect blend. You're welcome.﻿"

e504mj9;Spacemangspiff;1535525982.0;"Nyah uh "
e4z8xkv;DickMasterson;1535498700.0;"Someone complained and he answered? That’s funny. "
e4zktal;asteist;1535508825.0;"if people complain about the topics you cover no matter what, maybe the topics aren't the problem."
e4zbuog;tommy_twofeet;1535501230.0;"I almost downvoted you just as a kneejerk reaction to anything Maddox says but then I realized you sacrificed some of your time to grab that comment. F."
e4z9uvg;justchillouteveryone;1535499509.0;"This is a good example of how Maddox sees everything in black and white extremes. Dick strikes a good balance between extremes, and never goes too far serious or funny. Maddox, on the other hand, makes his show either all downer/serious or all goofy/trivial. There’s an extreme between spending an hour talking about farts and spending an hour talking about female genital mutilation, but Maddox just doesn’t get that and thinks it has to be one of the other"
e4z9r0t;AffirmativeNod;1535499416.0;"Heavy politics vs farts. How can you possibly find *any* reasonable in-between?"
e507z5w;SCShouter;1535529159.0;"Dear lord with the overreacting to criticism, then a paragraph about how great he is followed by "ur welcome" like that's his calling card that gets fans excited, Maddox is so painful to read"

e50170r;Brian-with-a-Y;1535522786.0;"So black and white. He takes the platitude of "you can't please everyone" to mean that he doesn't need to take ***any*** feedback or criticism seriously. "
e50d5jr;DickMasterson;1535534204.0;"Posting bonus content is against the rules of this subreddit."
e4znl6s;iamlovemonkey;1535511154.0;"Monogamy is so outdated guys, and jewelry is totally just a masculine way of trying to brand a woman as yours... Ignore the fact that I can't afford jewelry out of a 25 cent machine, that is not influencing my opinion. Denny's steaks are just as good as Ruth's Chris, even better actually! "

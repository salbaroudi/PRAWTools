999l8j;Phteven_j;1534934431.0;""

e4m0euq;Phteven_j;1534935635.0;"Transcript:> Hey Maddox,> Big fan I just wanted to tell you a few things. First off, I’m really disappointed in the person you’ve become. It’s just sad. I used to think you were one of the coolest and funniest guys on the internet. Now I wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire. You’ve let all this bullshit twist you up into a pathetic pretzel. It’s truly shocking the amount of bend over backwards you do to completely contradict your former image, what’s the deal? You seemed to be so principled during biggest problem, and now you can’t just man up and take a joke? You won’t allow any criticism or take honest questions from your fans. You’ve barricaded yourself behind the truly despicable human being Jessie PS to do all your dirty work fucking with people’s families. It’s truly reprehensible. Here’s the solution for you, just apologize and move on. I’ve come to realize that this whole feud, this whole podcast bullshit, is just one giant asshole being a total douche to another asshole. You can make up your own mind which is which. Thanks for suing me for $20 million dollars, that will be a story I’ll tell until the day I die. Too bad you didn’t have the follow through to actually serve me and just wanted a scare tactic? Maybe you couldn’t afford to have a sheriff’s deputy serve me and that’s why it never happened, whatever the case. Fuck you. It was your dumb fan voice George. You and I and literally everyone knows that, YOU FUCKING STILL DO IT TO THIS DAY. It has absolutely nothing to do with mocking people with Down Syndrome, like my sister you cowardly bag of dicks. You want to talk about harassment, how about I show the video of your employee sharing photos of my family, or the dozens of messages I have from your fans with personal information. Your fans who by the way seem consist solely of liars and pedophiles at this point, what a great legacy to leave behind. I hope Asterios counter sues you and reems out your asshole so wide they hold the next superbowl in the wreckage.> The lousy underhanded bullshit you pulled with him, for what? Not joining you in complete lockstep, making fun of you for being a cuck? You are a cuck, you’ve been cucked out of everything at this point. Through all this though, I tried to send you a message. I saw it, I’m not sure why you don’t see it. It’s time to retire. Your books have had a downward trend, just like you trying to pass the GRE, it’s time to call it quits. Why not move to Indiana, where cost of living is cheap, and no one will know who you are. You can do some IT for a small company, or writing for the local news, jesus get a job at the library, do anything. What you are doing now is clearly not working out, you lost, and as any genius and thought leader knows sometimes it is best to just fold and hope the next hand works out better. I’m sure you didn’t read this far, and I’ve already been blocked and banned from your discord, but I just wanted to get a few things off my chest. If by some miracle you do pull your head out of your ass, feel free to call-in to HWIDG, we’ll have you on as a special guest, and I’ll even let you edit the episode. Or you can leave us a voicemail, 704-750-9434 tell us what you don’t get. I hope your life gets back on track and you move on from all of this. At the same time I also hope you get attacked by a wild pack of dogs who rip your penis off. It’s hard trying to be the bigger person. Welp, that’s all for me assclown.> Sincerely,> Love,> Madcucks> P.S. Buck wants to know what the voting numbers were before you threw your bitch tantrum and ruined the voting again. Also when are you going to explain it to your dullard fans?> Thanks,> <his name>"

e4lzi92;tefloncondom;1534934714.0;"That is the most impossiblest thing to read on a phone. Is this a .JPEG?"
e4m6htw;mrnobano;1534942553.0;"Madcucks will forever be a national, no, a universal treasure. Love your shtick and go fuck yourself."
e4macy8;DoodSalamander;1534948549.0;"I am just really glad this wasn't directed at me. Fuck that's gonna feel bad when Maddox reads it. But you earned it Maddox."
e4m3zp8;FireballWhiskey26;1534939436.0;"I read all of that.Can I get a shout out."
e4m068z;Builtro;1534935394.0;"Eh, is that really him? Isn’t his name spelled differently? "
e4mfvgw;scott_zoloft;1534959914.0;"*In an extremely TDS voice*: "I like this!""
e4mk3go;ChaosCowboy;1534967463.0;"As a resident of Indiana, please refrain from encouraging Maddox to move here. We don't want him and he won't like it here."
e4mloca;CoronelPanic;1534969580.0;"Ah, he'll never explain it to his fans. They're there to have fun after all."
e4nixez;Moggenfeeb;1534998427.0;"MADCUCKS DONT YOU FUCKING DARE SEND HIM TO INDIANA WITH ME"
e4mpryu;BobJWHenderson;1534974071.0;"Good read. Didn’t know madcucks’ sis had Down syndrome. I always assumed madcucks himself had DS considering he looks like a fat retard. "
e4m8627;brotality_;1534944891.0;"You’re a saint"
e4mj7u9;Ben2749;1534966149.0;"Fuck, I spent 5 minutes squinting to read it, and then scroll down and see this."
e4nvcaw;Bankrupt84;1535009308.0;"Madcucks, Gods gift to TDS"
e4mjee3;Lpup;1534966427.0;"thank you that image was blurry and unreadable"
e4mws3x;Mutant_Dragon;1534980433.0;"Dude even NaT2 was still better than most"
e4lzvka;AbortTrap;1534935089.0;"Try this [https://imgur.com/download/mVkIJ8V/](https://imgur.com/download/mVkIJ8V/) I’ve noticed lately that stupid fucking imgur shrinks images on mobile and doesn’t let you see the full size version"
e4lzlhh;Phteven_j;1534934804.0;"It's a desktop screenshot, so definitely not mobile optimized."
e4mhwo0;BetterThanNot;1534963938.0;"Android has an option for "desktop site" which will override mobile detection and show you the full size image. That always makes it readable for me. Not sure if iPhone has that."
e4mj9pd;Ben2749;1534966229.0;"He won't read it. The instant he sees who it's from or realises it's criticism, he'll delete it."
e4m07bg;Phteven_j;1534935423.0;"He posted it on the HWIDG Discord just now."
e4mqggg;SkyfireAbove;1534974738.0;"I think a lot of people would love for Maddox to make you miserable."

e4mm1e0;tommy_twofeet;1534970017.0;"Shit. I upvoted this"
e4nvix6;Bankrupt84;1535009478.0;"Dude, he isnt’t going to Indiana lol, remember he only listens to beautiful good looking jock-like preppy men for 30k websites. He would never heed the good advice of former fans or friends."
e4oc9xc;MAGAmanBattleNetwork;1535026845.0;"So how long until we find out you're a pedophile too?"
e4mam7r;buffer_overfl0w;1534949012.0;"He's doing the lord's work. "

e4n3jxc;Rhalgarax;1534985896.0;"iPhone does but you have to find it on the share button screen. It’s called “Request Desktop Site”"

e4m17cx;Builtro;1534936421.0;"Gotcha"
e4mvisg;ChaosCowboy;1534979374.0;"To be honest I would enjoy the confrontation.Being a native Hoosier though, I can tell you, Maddox would hate living here, and the people around him would not like or understand him. Culturally it's about as bad a fit as Syrian refugees in the US."
e4n5m05;Greedav;1534987544.0;"As a non-Hoosier who goes to school in Indiana, I don’t know how you managed to live here so long without doing a high-dive from a parking garage.On second thought, maybe Maddox should come here."
e4n5qv1;ChaosCowboy;1534987651.0;"Purdue or IU?"
e4n6io5;Greedav;1534988275.0;"ND"
e4n6xa6;ChaosCowboy;1534988606.0;"That's practically Illinois. Not the real Indiana experience."
e4nj50k;Moggenfeeb;1534998599.0;"True. You need the weird homeless of Lafayette or the strange mix of country and hippie that is Bloomington to really get Indiana. "
e4njuwc;ChaosCowboy;1534999199.0;"Straight up indianapolis dude. Proudly called "naptown" by its' denizens."
e4nqa1t;Moggenfeeb;1535004679.0;"East side is the best side"

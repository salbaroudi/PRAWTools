9aifib;Ashanmaril;1535341981.0;Madcast sponsor, Little Platinum Books mysteriously gets fully funded with suspicious numbers (more inside)
9aifib;Ashanmaril;1535341981.0;"So, you may remember less than a couple weeks ago, Madcast Sponsor *Little Platinum Books* accused Dick of being a thief, as seen in this post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDickShow/comments/97k90s/madcast_sponsor_calls_dick_a_thief/This was just 11 days ago, and in the comments there you'll notice [some math I did](https://i.imgur.com/JeT9ziP.png) regarding their suspicious numbers. At the time, they had $3,680 pledged to their Kickstarter across 39 backers, equating to an average of $94 per backer. Already a high number for some children's books that don't exist yet. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.Little Platinum Books announced today that they hit their goal.  https://i.imgur.com/FGk7sFW.png  I was immediately suspicious because any simple extrapolation from their previous numbers -- even after getting their big ad campaign played on the flagship podcast of the very successful Madcast Media podcast network -- showed they weren't even close to hitting their goal. But somehow they did.At the time of writing, the Little Platinum Books Kickstarter is at $15,188 pledged across 50 backers:  https://i.imgur.com/hqRTPNF.png  Immediately something is wrong here. 11 backers pledged since my post 11 days ago, and it got them to their goal.  $15,188 - $3,680 = $11,508  $11,508 / 11 backers = $1,046.18 per backerThat's right, supposedly 11 people pledged over $1,000 each for some children's books. And not just any 11 people, 11 people who weren't even aware of the Kickstarter for the first few weeks it was up, but at some point during the campaign discovered it and were so excited by what they were doing that they gave that much."

e4vnw9k;playr1029;1535343073.0;"I knew a guy who did this very same thing. Instead of funding their business venture with their own money they begged friends and family for donations. If they didn't meet their goal by a certain date no one would be charged for their donation. $5000 short the day before he pledged the rest himself so he could collect on all the free money the backers pledged. I suspect this is probably the same situation"
e4vnb07;Slockaw;1535342509.0;"Also, I have never seen a company, if you can call it that, with less than 10 followers. I also just checked their Facebook it has 18,803 likes and 18,809 followers. So Twitter with 9 followers and following 9 people, then a 18,800 increase on Facebook.&#x200B;"

e4vpbvz;Antoids;1535344431.0;"i was posting about this on twitter, too! nice work!i did some math when it was at 49 backers and $12.5k! it had one backer at the $2.5k tier, and the rest of the backers added up to $2.5k themselves, meaning there was ~$7.5k unaccounted for, most likely donated by the guy in the $2.5k tier at the time. since then, one more backer has made it into another $2.5k tier, accounting for the difference between then and now.i definitely find it suspicious"

e4vtquv;danmanlott;1535348769.0;"EDIT: [I crunched the numbers and they don't add up.](https://imgur.com/1F6euCb) The only way this could work is paying extra ($100 for a $50 reward).Spoopy, I thought this might happen, there was no change from them sponsoring the episode for a few days until someone bought the $2500 package.

e4vnyl2;Ashanmaril;1535343134.0;"Yeah, it's a legit tactic if you're close to your goal but I think they must have funded 90% of this thing themselves. This isn't giving themselves a nudge over the goal, it's paying the entire way."

I know it seems really really stupid to spend 10k to make 5 but if you are trying to sell to family and friends you are self made this is a real thing."
e4w1gbl;Ashanmaril;1535357075.0;"Wouldn't these influencers be better giving them a plug than donating their own money? We can guarantee a plug hasn't been done or LPT would have tweeted about it, they tweeted when they were on Maddox's show.If they're influencers but don't even give plugs to the things they want to support isn't them being influencers completely irrelevant to them having enough money to give $2500 each?"
e4wqzs9;AffirmativeNod;1535395375.0;"If you can read deleted tweets, we need to retweet related deets."
e4wcg2r;Ashanmaril;1535369083.0;"That's what I thought but usually when that happens it's mentioned to the backers and on social media.And Little Platinum Books has actually commented on this on Twitter, they claim 2 YouTube influencers pledged enough to fund the remainder. Which doesn't really make any sense and is not at all how social media influencers work. Usually you have a product and you pay the influencer to show off your thing so people will go buy it. But apparently in this case the influencer just gave them a bunch of money but didn't mention them to their many fans in order to get them even MORE money??"
e4xvqmj;Ashanmaril;1535435200.0;"I think flexible funding goals on Kickstarter require a good explanation. If there's a dollar amount you need to publish your book, you can't just get 5% of your goal and take the money cause it's not like you can put that money towards publishing 5% of the book or something. You either get the amount of money required, or you don't.I don't think they're concerned about throwing money away, they just want to look successful now that they have eyes on them."
e4vn1rl;Ashanmaril;1535342265.0;"I kinda doubt it's against the Kickstarter TOS to fund your own campaign, which I'm guessing is most likely what happened. And no matter where the money comes from, Kickstarter gets a cut of it so they have no reason to care."

e4wceun;Scarecrow3;1535369044.0;"So if they're buying page likes and fudging Kickstarters right after they start doing business with Maddox, this raises questions about his own follower/patreon counts too, right?

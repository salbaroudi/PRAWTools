e4fio03;DoYouKnowofMe;1534657423.0;"“...Every debate in the Universe from hairlines that recede to stolen iTunes feeds.”He knows he’s the one that stole the feed though, right?"
e4fgd9l;RazorCandies;1534655026.0;"Tell me how he can explain 571972 votes when there was barely 30 comments on that video. Anyone even looking at it can see the voting was fucked. I mean what a fucking idiot. "
e4fii68;DoYouKnowofMe;1534657255.0;"“People have been asking what happened to the feed. We’re going to talk about that, but not today. Today we’re going to have fun.” HahaI’m looking for where he talks about the voting results still. Anyone have a timestamp? "

e4fikca;Qayden;1534657317.0;"Maddox really is a perfect mark. Some guy can walk up to him and say "it's your lucky day, I am in desperate need of money and will sell you this $10000 Rolex for just $500 if you give me the money right now"."

e4fmais;jibmob;1534661213.0;"There is a gem at the end. Maddox is saying something and the balder fatter guy gets up and starts saying goodbye, cutting Maddox off. The squeaky voice newsbabe twink tells him to join some sort of activity. Maddox pipes up with, hey I'm down too. The twink starts hemming and hawing about Maddox's knee, and fretting whether Maddox will be ok. Maddox keeps pushing and the twink resists. Delicious and awkward. "
e4fnfje;Ben2749;1534662411.0;"He’s doing it to try and troll the Dick fanbase. But all it does is make him look like a liar to any remaining fans he has, or that he manipulated the votes himself."

e4goj16;IfYouListenToFools;1534717813.0;"Wow... this is beyond sad. So, let me see if I got this right:* He gets a record number of votes (because of dickheads fucking with him)* He makes it so the webpage always displays "571972 vs 571972" so dickheads can't vote anymore.* Then he brags about the number he just made up, as if   * A. Anyone would believe him.   * B. He didn't already have a record number of votes in the first place.* On top of it all, he gets the numbers wrong. He says he has 571972 fake votes, when in reality he has (571972 + 571972) fake votes.Guys, I begin to feel guilty about laughing at this individual...  "

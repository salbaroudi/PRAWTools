9b2a7c;MyroomRecords;1535515554.0;"Dick wants so badly to get someone to call in from the Facebook group who isn't a terrible cringe filled sperg. Sooner or later he has to realize they all will be awful... Every... Goddamned... One...Edit: Captain Jackass can stay. He's the ONLY exception."

e4zzbmv;CaptainJackass95;1535521109.0;"Gentlemen! Thank you all for the kind words. I always know that I'll find positive comments about myself on the most negative posts about Facebook. Its really appreciated. I'm an active lurker on here. Dick has told me in a bunch of different emails that I'm welcomed on really whenever. That's me dropping the ball by not being there. I do, however, have a good rage in mind for my next call. Thanks again."
e4ztcyd;Builtro;1535516007.0;"He could have Captain Jackass on the show again. He was great last time he called in. "
e4ztqwf;TMacsLazyEye;1535516336.0;"That dude was a fucking soundboard of angry facebook buzzwords"Ive emailed Sam Hyde so I have some clout""
e4ztche;Qayden;1535515995.0;"He was like "you're not a true edgelord like me, because you don't call your black friends niggers and fart in your girlfriends face""
e4zvn1g;ShawnGalt;1535517934.0;"Facebook needs to be banned from calling inor just gas all of them but Cpt. Jackass"
e5063j6;scott_zoloft;1535527372.0;"his name is mason and his favorite things are eyeing the room before slowly saying the n word, showing me gay pcitures on his phone, and looking at me waiting for a reactionhis least favorite things are pc culture and showering"
e4zyw4e;Rhalgarax;1535520727.0;"Nick Racketts is a Facebook."
e4zul4d;tehpikey;1535517036.0;"The guy who does the news is a genius, one of my favourite spots on the show. "
e502nap;JonnyJuanito;1535524153.0;"It’s funny that he pronounces cum like KOOM.You know it’s funny because he made sure to say it three dozen times so we could hear it"
e504w2k;scott_zoloft;1535526228.0;"i was thinking about posting some of my bikes a little later"
e5053ir;scott_zoloft;1535526422.0;"also i met a big ol fat guy with grease all over his mouth who reminded me a lot of you guys, maybe i could ask him to call TDS"
e4zxrew;SueLightningsPenis;1535519754.0;"The in studio guest Erik Wong from last week was a facebooker I believe"
e501mdp;ZooRaped;1535523187.0;"The problem may be that Dick is a Facebook. "
e504nsq;Gleeroy95;1535526014.0;"As soon as the call started I knew I'd be in for some cringe, as soon as I heard "can I talk now" I knew that I knew nothing"
e4zvf63;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535517748.0;"Technically he's not a Dickhead, like he said, he's the Dustin of Sam Hyde's group, so I don't blame the TDSFBG for him being on the show. I do blame them for everything else they do, just not this specific instance."
e502k2u;RobotOverlord328;1535524072.0;"We need someone to filter the calls ins and just ask "Are you in the facebook group?" if the answer is yes just kick them off the line. "
e506lcj;SCShouter;1535527838.0;"Facebook news rules but the only thing funny about Rommel was the cringe factor of how awful he was. Man he couldn't even get the hint to hang up for like a solid minute. It's always nice to hear a guy with no social skills ramble about "banging hot chicks maaannnn" yuck"
e50c28b;dubb5ack;1535533165.0;"I spend more time on facebook than this spergy basement and I completely agree.  EDIT:  Accent competition between Dame Pesos and Bleh.  "
e5006ij;HackTheMovies;1535521868.0;"Im in the Facebook group and dont think I've been too cringey with my call ins....maybe cause Im not calling in as a FBG member"
e505taq;SpicyTonyPA;1535527103.0;"Can someone make a supercut of him saying "like" with that TBPITU ding?"
e509b24;Skeptimus;1535530430.0;"I'd get fired if I called in.."
e50ebk9;KansasCityChris;1535535292.0;"I’d rather have Adam Nash back on. "
e500pyx;Teddybearsyrup;1535522354.0;"Love this guy"
e4ztzf5;JMC266;1535516534.0;"I like Captain Jackass, he has the uncanny ability to harness autism and cringe from the Facebook and make something tolerable for the rest of us."
e4zttld;MyroomRecords;1535516400.0;"Okay so he's the exception. "
e4zugri;Feelinggood11;1535516935.0;"Legitimately the only funny thing he said and he didn't even mean to."
e509ip6;rusted-nail;1535530634.0;"literally just doing sam hyde's shtick but badly"
e503u0n;tommy_twofeet;1535525256.0;"But if we gassed all the Facebook spergs then what would Cpt. Jackass report on? We rely on the unhinged retards in the FB group for our entertainment. "
e50cwtm;BloodFartTheQueefer;1535533976.0;"This comment is WAY too on topic for you"
e4zyz1j;MyroomRecords;1535520798.0;"So am I but he's also a Reddit and doesn't call in as a representative of Facebook."
e50c9nt;dubb5ack;1535533364.0;"He's on everything.  That doesn't count.  There is a moderately funny beef between him and one of the fb group admins tho..."
e506v2w;SCShouter;1535528094.0;"So there was this dog right? He was outside. Let me reiterate, it was a DOG! Then I blasted my koom all over her bags of sand, then I heard the DOG outside. So while this hawt chick who was totally not fat (thicccc bro not fat) the koom was sitting on her stomach. Then I heard the dog scratching outside the door. So then I said "babe wanna wipe the KOOM off you with a moist towlette?" She was like sure. Let me remind you THERE WAS A DOG OUTSIDE. so I opened the door to get her wipes for all my KOOM off her totally not fat stomach, and the dog came in the room. You're not gonna believe what happened next!What a punchline telegraphing douche he was"
e507ptc;Administrative_Loan;1535528910.0;"For being so proud of it, it's not even original.  He's just copying the way his idol Sam Hyde says it in his "Moms" video. "
e50cx3d;BloodFartTheQueefer;1535533984.0;"that's more like it"
e4zzfcz;CaptainJackass95;1535521198.0;"He is"
e4zz0or;MyroomRecords;1535520839.0;"Comparing him to Dustin is appropriate."
e4zyqjz;sweetb00bs;1535520589.0;"His shoehorning in the word coom 4 times in under a minute was bad. "
e4zxtww;CXMetalX;1535519813.0;"I thought "I didn't mean to come off as a weirdo" at the end was also pretty funny."
e50cno8;BloodFartTheQueefer;1535533732.0;"He does a good enough job that I think he would manage doing well with something else"
e50elrz;Greedav;1535535557.0;"I'm not convinced scott has ever actually listened to TDS."
e4zzrx0;Rhalgarax;1535521509.0;"Yeah. This whole “representative” thing is dumb. Except for when that’s the joke. "
e5025t9;Rhalgarax;1535523695.0;"Holy shit. Just heard this guy. I’d rather listen to Nash call again. "

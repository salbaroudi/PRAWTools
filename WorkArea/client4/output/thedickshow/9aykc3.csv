e4yzlzu;Lpup;1535489712.0;"I personally am happy for this. Now we know Maddox will have some money to pay Asterios once the sanctions motions hit"
e4yyyv4;iamlovemonkey;1535488981.0;"I'm honestly surprised Patreon lets him on their platform after the lolsuit. He violated their tos and should be banned. "
e4yz5p3;DrunkGrapist;1535489201.0;"Its Little Platinum Book paying back Maddox."
e4yz09v;lakembra;1535489029.0;"Yesterday: [44 Patrons. $191/month.](https://i.imgur.com/WgtEZfM.jpg)   Today: [45 patrons. $6554/month.](https://i.imgur.com/MTaAxLw.jpg).   Oh man, they didn't even claim the [Benefactor Tier](https://i.imgur.com/MB9GxvH.jpg).   But on the brightside, [we're getting a new show every week!](https://i.imgur.com/VdFGJU6.jpg).   Also I think I fucked up the number. What am I, a calculator?   Edit: [Oh no, someone unpledged!](https://i.imgur.com/JtlVIsA.jpg)"
e4z1drj;The_Atticus;1535491635.0;"\>Gets a Patreon donation of over $6,000\>Still not even a third of Dick's PatreonMadoff just can't catch a break."
e4z7llb;SKRUZO;1535497526.0;"Such a one-step thinker. The second that pledge drops, he'll have forever stained his Patreon as the one that dropped over 97% in a single day. "
e4zi6cy;pitbulldeathsquad;1535506614.0;"If it's not a troll then its definitely some sort of half-baked accounting scam. Maybe he needed proof of income for an apartment lease or something."
e4z17hd;boedo;1535491430.0;"Madbots?"
e4yzgas;callofthedeep;1535489534.0;"But he has zero patrons giving $1000 or more.  Is Saddox trying to launder money or something?"
e4yz46a;portuguese-charlie;1535489153.0;"Maybe that little platinum books guy became Maddox’s sugar daddy?"
e4yzvnr;MomentOfXen;1535490014.0;"At this rate he needs to trade with three more kickstarters to catch up to Dick, you can do it Maddox!"
e4zft01;juiciusmaximus3;1535504560.0;"What is the likelihood that Maddox is committing some kind of fraud here?"
e4z0g7y;Mr-Scurvy;1535490637.0;"Could this be a troll job? Wasn't one of the later in bit conspiracy dipshits claiming you can pledge any amount of money and set to not get charged until the first of the month but it still shows up on their page? Then you just cancel the payment?"
e4z2hsv;UghImAWriter;1535492782.0;"well, this isn't 571972 so it can't be a hijacking, can't be a hack done by dirty dick"
e4z5yvk;AlexWyvern;1535496062.0;"Great, now he's got something that can be counter-sued for."
e4z9ejt;drmcmoney;1535499114.0;"I'll take 'money laundering' for $500, Alex."
e4z16bp;SpicyTonyPA;1535491396.0;"Let's see if he will [respond]( https://imgur.com/lHxr56M.jpg)"
e4z3nl9;Dingus_Inc;1535493910.0;"Isn't today the last day he can respond to the asterios case?"
e4z9p20;elvoggo;1535499369.0;"A couple of days after little platinum books got a few $2000 donations. Something fucky is going on here"
e503t3z;bionic86;1535525234.0;"So basically George managed to get approved for a credit card with a 6k limit?"
e4zomb0;backwards7ven;1535512019.0;"Are we seeing the financial results of 'born receiver' Maddox taking the first tentative steps into the seamy world of extreme fetish porn?"
e4zybll;NumberEightySeven;1535520229.0;"There's obvious fuckery going on here. Either Maddox put that money in there, or Little Platinum Books did. This could be another violation of Patreon's TOS."
e4z00sk;Moggenfeeb;1535490171.0;"Hmm."
e4z92vr;deegan258;1535498831.0;"I just don’t know what the game is, here. Does he want people to think he’s a big deal again, aka fake it til you make it? Pretty sad I’d thats the case. "
e4zb9uy;SnakeJerusalem;1535500727.0;"The plot thickens..."
e507yx4;FireballWhiskey26;1535529153.0;"I think maybe he learned a neat trick from a sponsor"
e50a0xq;tickjones;1535531175.0;"I wonder if he's putting money into his own patreon so that he can convince some lawyer that he'll have enough money to pay for filing against Asterios again."
e50dkrw;dubb5ack;1535534601.0;"Assuming LPB isn't Maddox, which they could be, I think they're both trying to make some noise with their numbers.  They might be literally trading donations, or maybe submitting credit card payments they'll withdraw.  They want people to see rising numbers and either sponsor them or donate.  I hope this counts as fraud so they can get prosecuted.  "
e4ze2q6;Disrah1;1535503110.0;"Don't forget that tax lien too"
e4zwm67;Basherballgod;1535518759.0;"He u/dickmasterson looks like Maddox now has the cash to pay you back that $5,000 he owes you"
e4z1dqo;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535491635.0;"They could be preparing a counter response but just taking their time, or he means so little to them that they'd rather worry about more important things."
e4z7tjw;TheWuggening;1535497723.0;"He's also the reason that Dick is getting the patreoni dollars that he is (which they get a nice cut of). Without that rape apologist video, Dick's patreon would be 1/4 of what it is today.Maddox made it rain for patreon."
e4z1vlo;Workamania;1535492160.0;"He violated their ToS by not going to arbitration for disputes."
e4z55lh;smokecutter;1535495313.0;"Seeing how they gave Maddox 20 bucks on a superchat (which youtube takes %30). It's very possible that they're stupid enough to pay Maddox through Patreon (5%) just so Maddox can feel like a big boy for 1 month."
e4z0yjn;ozzie_ozzie;1535491169.0;"The way their kickstarter reached their goal seems to be a whole ruse with LPB already having the money, making it look like it got crowdfunded (but self- or friend-funded) and the cash inserted into Maddox publicly to give him some ePeen.&#x200B;Smells fishy as Tyrone's dong."
e4zhxwh;drmcmoney;1535506413.0;"You are just riding his enigma."
e4yz7o1;ozzie_ozzie;1535489265.0;"$6,363 patron. Who is Gege?"
e4zrz9b;Basherballgod;1535514846.0;"Likely, someone who was pledging $1 upped it to $6k just before end of month, as I don’t think you get charged immediately for an increase, only for a new pledge. If it doesn’t tank in October, I will eat a Little Platinum Book."
e507cqf;SCShouter;1535528561.0;""contact me for discussion"Hahahaha"
e4z1fht;lakembra;1535491688.0;"Why have thousands of very small patreon bots when you can just have one very big patreon bot? It's called being efficient. If you had a programmer's brain you'd understand."
e4z3tfb;derek_gagnon;1535494064.0;"I noticed that too."
e4zud6n;Feelinggood11;1535516852.0;"I wouldn't put it past him to try and launder money by spending his own money. "
e4z89x1;stoney_bolognas;1535498125.0;"if its a 1 time thing then MAYBE I can see that but if its "re-occuring" i wouldnt believe it. But even then.....if the dude has a kickstarter, then why would he need one if he's funding maddox now?"
e4z0jkw;lakembra;1535490735.0;"I reckon someone's having a bit of fun, yeah."
e4z8ptp;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1535498512.0;"The creator chooses whether you have to pay when you first start or pay on the first of the month. It's their choice because artists would have people pledge, rip their material, then unpledge."
e4z8egc;koala_ambush;1535498236.0;"Doubt it. Some guy on here said first payment is up front to prevent people just backing out immediately. "
e4z5h1w;jibmob;1535495605.0;"Good use of the time. He's really having a mental breakdown. "
e4z4gbt;justchillouteveryone;1535494660.0;"Probably the latter. They probably didn’t lose enough to worry about a counter suit"
e50d43g;dubb5ack;1535534167.0;"I saw that video when it came out and didn't even know there was a Dick Show.  What got me on the Patreon was wanting to hear the goss on the bonus episodes.  "
e4z1f9v;ozzie_ozzie;1535491680.0;"My Patreon cache when searching for Maddox says 45 @ $213.Now currently $6,553.So possibly "the big payoff" was $6,340."
e50bnpe;Antoids;1535532780.0;"/u/dickmasterson give this man a shirt if he delivers"
e4z2rsr;boedo;1535493060.0;"Ah well I’m not a superior mind you see. "
e4zriwg;Basherballgod;1535514465.0;"Never use your own money when you can use other peoples"
e5099b3;SueLightningsPenis;1535530382.0;"Nothing about that guy makes any sense. He pays Maddox to advertise a funding campaign and donates generously back to Maddox to support him. If there was large capital or audiences involved, I would get it, but as is it's like they're just giving money back and forth to each other."
e4z93z2;jagermitchell;1535498858.0;"Why trust that random guy when you can check yourself? I just checked and Maddox doesn't have immediate payment set up, it still bills first payment at the beginning of the next billing cycle. "
e50d16i;dubb5ack;1535534091.0;"Then why did WS fire Asterios?  Did it really matter that much to them?"
e4z3zdi;VHSFANSUBS;1535494219.0;"Can you troll someone’s patreon and say you’re giving a shitload of money and then back out at the last minute to not pay anything?"
e4zbqk4;Jack-Browser;1535501132.0;"Get out of here with your research and fact-checking!"
e50eiak;justchillouteveryone;1535535465.0;"My guess is it’s because Weber Shandwick is a pr firm (so they are concerned about their image), they’re located in New York, and they were accused of outright criminal activity. Patreon, by contrast, was only accused of not responding to customer service complaints (which is completely legal) and all they had to do to get it dismissed was point out the improper forum. It was probably pretty  (comparatively) cheap for patreon’s lawyer on retainer to get their lawsuit dismissed, whereas Weber Shandwick probably spent a bit more time and money. Keep in mind though that I’m not a law and I’m not at all privy to the behind the scenes any more than the average dickhead"
e4z4jbm;justchillouteveryone;1535494739.0;"Not anymore. They used to bill you at the start of each month, but people just pledged and backed out. Now your first payment is made the moment you sign up"
e4z8xq1;jagermitchell;1535498704.0;"Not by default and Maddox doesn't have that feature set up. Right now if you pledge to him, it doesn't bill until the beginning of the month. This could definitely be a troll."
e4z9nne;SpartanPhi;1535499336.0;"He probably has some dumb moral reason to explain how easy it is to troll."

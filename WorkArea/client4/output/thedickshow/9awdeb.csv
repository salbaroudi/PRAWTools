But it has a point that I 100% agree with - it's the "Whatever DNS Comes By Default" part. If Google/Amazon/whatever DNS services creep in with Android phones, Chromebooks, or any other product they make, that will be another nail in the coffin of the Interwebs. Whatever is the default in any system or in any software 90-99% of people will use that. You need some exceptional circumstances to change that."

98ewj5;buffer_overfl0w;1534654749.0;Maddox Sucks at Code
98ewj5;buffer_overfl0w;1534654749.0;"Since Dick posted that image of the MadcastMedia console output and it got me thinking I'm going to take a look at the script (page-audio.js) and see what it does. While reading I realized it was dog-shit so I'm going to review it.The page-audio.js was the only file that it seems Saddox wrote, everything else being third parties.# CommentsIn Javascript comments are not important and not generally strict on how they are done but generally we stick to the JSDoc standard.Maddox comments are a special type of deranged, such as the following block:    /*=======================================================================*\        VARIABLES    \*=======================================================================*/    var voteInProgress = false;No shit it's a variable and why the shitty formatting? are you programming on 640x400 resolution monitor? We have a similar block to mark Functions (or methods as they are called in other languages).Document comments on functions are fucking stupid. For instance:    /*=======================================================================*\        Function:	updateWidgetBeforeAfter        Purpose:	Updates shitty idiots opinions before and after cool as shit podcast episode        Input:	showName = Which best podcast in the universe to load stupid users opinions from     		showEpisode = Which best episode in the universe of best podcast in the universe to load stupid users opinions from        Output:		Shitty dipshit users opinions rendered to awesome websites screen    \*=======================================================================*/    ar updateWidgetBeforeAfter = function(showName, showEpisode) { /**/ }'Function:', what? We know what the fucking function is called... We generally write Inputs as params as value type and the output as what we are returning as a value and type.This would be a better way to do comments:    /**     * This function updates the voting widget, I'm a cuck and a sore looser     * @param {string} showName The name of the shitty show     * @param {number} showEpisode The shitty episode for the show     * @return {void}     */    var updateWidgetBeforeAfter = function(showName, showEpisode) { /**/ }I wouldn't accept a pull request with this level of retardation *F-*.## Structure - this is a big reviewOne thing I noticed there was no breaks between anything, for instance line spaces between a blocks of code; like having a bunch of variables set away from logic like *IF*s and *FOR*s. If your going to make the effort with comments at least make the effort by making it more readable.The The first *if* statement is the following:    if ((isNaN(showEpisode)) || ((showList.indexOf(showName) == -1))) {        console.log('Invalid Show Name / Episode Number');        return(false);    }Wow... I would accept this from a pull request. The return statement is not a function, and why the extra parenthasis around `(isNaN(showEpisode)`? It's not needed. The following code would be more acceptable:    if (isNaN(showEpisode) || (showList.indexOf(showName) == -1)) {        return false;    }The console output should be for debugging. Also further down the code you will notice lots and lots of *if* staments nested, this makes for bad code and also makes it harder to debug while increasing the complexity of your code - which is bad unless your a level 100 Autist. One way to break down the number of *if* statements would be to use a *switch* statement; Maddox is a dipshit.*F-*.## DebuggingWhen debugging Javascript, you would typically use `console.output()` for outputting variables; you wouldn't allow these to be in production code unless you miss one maybe? Not a shitload. If you need to debug production code, why not use breakpoints. At least break points might help traverse though that shithole spaghetti mess.    console.log('Hey asshole, get out my fucking console. For Madcast awesome admins only.');Sad.*F-*.## Shits and GigglesThe bit that Dick shown was the following code:    //Function to detected when crappy opinion saved into awesome Madcast database / hive mind    xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {        //Did it save? Not that I care.        if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200) {    	//Work out JSON so can tell    	var crappyOpinionResponse = JSON.parse(xmlhttp.responseText).response;    	//Was it successfull? Or need a recaptcha because user is an asshole?    	//**DO** IP locked for now losers    	//Update results    	updateWidgetBeforeAfter(episodeMeta.showShortName, episodeMeta.episodeNumber);    	//Respond challenge    	var xmlhttpChallenge = new XMLHttpRequest();    	console.log('Fucking dickheads, fucking with my votes, eat this, try again now dickwad!: ' + crappyOpinionResponse.challenge);    	xmlhttpChallenge.open("GET", 'http://api.madcastmedia.com/?challenge=' + crappyOpinionResponse.challenge, true);    	console.log('GET: ' + 'http://api.madcastmedia.com/?challenge=' + crappyOpinionResponse.challenge);    	xmlhttpChallenge.send();        }        //Voting is over douchebag, unlock so can change your mind if you are an idiot        voteInProgress = false;    }It looks like Maddox was butt hurt. Poor Maddox ;'(*F-*.## ConclusionI wouldn't get Maddox to write software for me, I think he's better off sticking to shitty podcasts.Maddox minify your javascript dipshit and then we wouldnt get all those console.outputs and I wouldnt be able to review your code :)"

e4fyd0t;wiseaus_stunt_double;1534674245.0;"Technically, it's only a method if it's within a class/object.  Also, I wouldn't accept code in a pull request with a == comparison since that forces the interpreter to check all kinds of truth since JS is dynamically typed.  Saying:    if (xmlhttp.status == 200)Is equivalent to:    if(xmlhttp.status === 200 || xmlhttp.status === "200")It's even slower if you're comparing against false.  If you know the type, use ===.  I'm with you on using JSDoc.  Not only is it cleaner that whatever commenting system he's using, but it also is there for docgen code to scrape and understand so that it'll output clean documentation for you.Some things you left out of your critique:    //Create XMLHttpRequest object like a bad ass pro, no fucking jQuery, jQuery's for pussies1) His XHR code is super copypasta.  That's the same code I first started using when I was learning about XHR/AJAX over ten years ago.  2) His XHR methods hint at Maddox not understanding that functions are first-class objects in JS.  Seriously, create a wrapper for your XHR calls and pass in your callback to it like a normal human.  Better yet, ditch that and just use the Fetch API.  3) He writes an XHR method for every call.  Does this motherfucker not know about DRY?  Doubt it since he's repeating himself all over the place.  4) jQuery exists for a reason.  If you want to support older browsers or not have to deal with browser incompatibility issues, use a framework.  The only time I don't use a framework is if I know I'm only targeting one specific browser like a Cordova app or hardware with an embedded browser.And, then there's his comments.  He really hates his fans when he's writing comments like:    //Detect when monkey presses buttonAnd    //Highlight your choice so you don't forget what you picked dumbassAnd    //Set some pretty pussy bar charts so you dipshits who can't calculate math in your head as fast as me can see some pretty pictures (assholes)Meanwhile    //Console logs for expertsRetard"

e4h440g;wiseaus_stunt_double;1534733309.0;"His code isn't something new developers should aspire to.  His code runs fine, I suppose, but the problem that many of us have is the issue of maintainability.  If you plan on working alone forever or never getting into the dev business, the issues we've raised are hardly a concern; however, once you join a team, that messy code is unsustainable.  Whether we're talking about Maddox's poor comments or his inability to grasp the DRY principle, his code makes it difficult for the next developer to come in and work on it.  But, I guess that's fine once he decides he needs to make updates or add new features and he has to fork out another $30k to a developer who will have to rework this garbage.Meanwhile, there's potential performance issues with his site.  As /u/buffer_overfl0w pointed out, never put console.log() into production code.  The reason being is each call has to eval() the parameters in the console -- which slows down the Javascript engine.  It's fairly negligible on desktop, but on mobile/tablet, it's far more noticeable.  Also, the fact that he's transmitting his long-winded code unminified on every page load is a big issue as the browser has to wait for his JS before it can even render the page.  And, he should be concerned about this since AWS charges for bandwidth -- unminified JS/CSS is literally costing him money.  But, if he wants to spend his money poorly, that's his prerogative.  Still, if he just minified his shit, he could use the savings to buy a new bike or a case of Fireball.  Hell, he could even use that money to start a new LOLSuit.On second thought, Maddox, keep doing what you're doing."

The only framework that may lock you into a SPA might be Angular, but even then you can just bypass the router component if you so chose.  And, jQuery doesn't even support routing/SPA out of the bag.  But, I guess Maddox would rather pay $30k for a website that has browser-specific bugs and re-invents the wheel when someone else has done most of the work for you for free."

e4h3aq5;buffer_overfl0w;1534732503.0;"> That's what Babel's for. ;)You make a good point, at work they decided to go the React way which is fucking crap; if you don't mind fussing over props, a redux store which makes no sense unless you have a Masters in Computer Sci. Anyway the lead developer said not to use the fetch API because of IE; ah well it's not my project and I hope I don't have to maintain it either.React Native is just as shit; using Typescript makes it easier but it's still shit."
e4h00b2;wiseaus_stunt_double;1534729305.0;"I've only used it on Angular projects, but I'm not a fan of having to declare every possible type that I may receive in the response payload from a REST call.  I'm cool with static typing for the most part, but having to define classes for every possible outcome just seems overly pedantic."
e4h57od;wiseaus_stunt_double;1534734395.0;"Aww...  I actually like React, and I prefer it over Angular due to it's implementation of an actual Shadow DOM.  Then again, I haven't had to use Redux that much, and I don't mind props since it's part of the Web Components spec. That sucks your tech lead denied the Fetch API -- worst case scenario, you write a polyfill for that since it's basically XHR with Promises.React Native might be shit, but it saves you from having separate codebases for your website and mobile apps."
e4h327q;buffer_overfl0w;1534732269.0;"With typescript the types are optional. Also the request from Angular's HTTP Client is always a `HttpResponse`.```this.http.get("example.com").subscribe(    (resp: HttpResponse): void => console.log("resp", resp));```If you find Typescript pedantic stay away from Go."
e4h76v1;buffer_overfl0w;1534736370.0;"Nah we just filled it in with another http client.  React has a love hate relationship, I prefer angular since it's a full fledged framework, routers, form validation, reactive components as well as observables etc... Typescript with react is a lot better.```interface Props {    isEnabled: boolean;    onPress: (event: Event) => void;}interface State {    //}export class CuckButton extends Component<Props, State> {   //}```Using a good IDE would populate the props for your component.

e4h5lo9;wiseaus_stunt_double;1534734780.0;"I know the types are optional, but it's still frustrating when someone has defined a type on a method, and the data you're passing to it is basically of type any.  It would be nice to just say it's type Object, but I can't do that since the compiler says a property doesn't exist on type Object, and you can't really do that on an any type, either (at least not in Angular 6).Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Go, and I've never understood the purpose it served.

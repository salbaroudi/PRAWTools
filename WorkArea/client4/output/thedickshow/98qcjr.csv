e4i0ems;brobafett1980;1534766597.0;"He just needs to file an amended complaint in the old case and email it to Greenburger (or what ever is proper under the NY rules or what is agreed upon service). Asterios has already appeared and is represented by counsel, so Maddox doesn't have to serve him directly. "

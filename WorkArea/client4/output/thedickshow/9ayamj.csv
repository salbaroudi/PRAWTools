Then as soon as their shitty jokes don't fly the thin vinear of confidence fades away so quickly and they're suddenly saying "no one likes me in the group" "sorry if I came off weird" "this is my first time" "I'm not actually like that""

e4z9pk6;-HOPHUNTER;1535499381.0;"that rape joke guy was so fuckin cringe, made bland tryhard jokes that didn’t land then didn’t even have the nuts to commit to them. his entire video was just a straight up rip off of sam hyde’s style without any of the nuance or subtlety that makes Sam funny. i can’t imagine how lame and cringe his “fans” are "

e4zc0yq;backwards7ven;1535501382.0;"So the entire show felt like a lucid dream that you can't wake up from. There's a parallel universe where tennis pro Dick rages at umpires on the centre court at Wimbledon until the Queen orders club officials to subdue him with ball cannons, before wrapping him up in one of the nets.I would pass off the Mumkey Jones film as an acid flashback if I didn't have it cued-up on YouTube. If he can maintain the production values of the first 20 seconds for the full 23 minutes then it is going to be great.Was the Rape Joker pretending to be an edgy teen trapped inside the body of an incel, or is he really a man whose peak fame will be a posthumous entry in the 24 hour news cycle, ending with the line: "before turning the gun on himself." For the record, I am good with either."
e4yyq42;BachelorHusband;1535488695.0;"The best part about the octave lower Spanish is when they dub someone's voice and it doesn't match at all. One of my friends was on the History Channel show Alone and he has a typical nasally Midwestern voice. They subbed the show into Spanish and suddenly this chubby Nebraska kid had a hilariously deep bass voice."

The link doesn't work "ohh...it wasn't anything bad or anythingmmmrrrmrmmmm play this one wahhh....." *fuck* this guyEDIT: My bad, my voicemail was chopped up. Sean was right, I was supposed to sing a song to a girl in the purple dress but was told the girl was wearing a green dress. Don't ask your musician friend to help you propose via song. That song is forever ruined for me. I'll never forget that look from the green dress girl."

e4z2dz0;MomentOfXen;1535492677.0;"So I've bandied this about randomly but I'm really convinced it would really help the education system out.So, high school is too easy and college is too bloated with unnecessary class. So why not take the "general" courses from college and move them down to the high school level? So that high school kids can take that astronomy or literature class, it'll be infinitely more interesting than "English 10" for them and hopefully actually challenge them so people like me can't graduate high school with a 3.7 after also getting written up for sleeping in class every day. So, with this change your college education takes two years, cutting tuition in half. So with another two for a masters and you now have a four year education that actually means something."

How fucking insecure are you that you based your entire personality on being edgy and offensive but still have to ask every 3 minutes if your jokes are working."
e507g0g;derk662;1535528649.0;"Those kind of jokes work earnestly and or ironically. Earnestly where we are laughing at you i.e. the dumb redneck making racists jokes. Ironically where everyone is in on the irony i.e. a comedian/entertainer making racists jokes."

e4z7wc1;lolmonade;1535497791.0;"That’s more or less what the utility of community college is.  Getting an associates (2-year) degree is getting all of those gen ed classes out of the way at usually a much less expensive price than what you’d pay for a public or private university.  With some exceptions, all those credits are usually transferable to nearby public universities.I’m a parent of 2 boys, I consider it part of my responsibility to make sure their expectations for college life are leveled appropriately.  Stay at home for the first two years and get your associates, take that time to learn what you want to do for a career, make that career choice in your early 20s rather than making a boneheaded choice right out of high school that ends up costing you tens of thousands of dollars to learn from that mistake.I’m also not opposed to them taking a year off and just working between high school and college.  There was a lot of scare tactics when I was a teenager about how kids who take a gap year just end up not going to higher education. That 1) assumes that college is the only way when there are trade schools that can lead to lucrative careers, and 2) that it’s a good idea to send an 18 year old child to college on a mortgage’s worth of debt to figure it out.I have a good career and salary, but My brother makes about 20k more than me a year, being about 6 years older than me, and has 0 college debt, getting a certification in heating and air conditioning.  Maybe my tune will change if my salary doubles in the next 10 years of my career, but so far, I’d say he’s “winning”."
e4z5h95;Pestosterone;1535495610.0;"High schools don't have the necessary amount of competent teachers to start throwing in a bunch of weird, random classes. The quality would be abysmal and kids would end up hating the subjects. With the quality being so low there's no way they'd rightfully be qualified to participate in that field. It would come down to how the system already is. You pay for a good private education or you get a shitty public one."

e4z8yos;SithisTheDreadFather;1535498728.0;"AP classes are a fucking scam. Practically no university actually gives a shit about them, and they don't apply if you don't score a 4 or 5 (which is a moving target because the grades are on a curve). Or, if they do apply, it's for classes not on your degree plan. Dual credit was where it was at, mainly because you took them at an actual community college. I was so lied to in high school about AP. "

Dick went off on a rant a while back about how school shootings are so rare they shouldn't count as news. What exactly do you think I'm trying to say "my opponents" believe?Here's the point of my original post. It's funny to think about what people consider harbingers of the end times and what they write off as being unimportant. For some people, the Parkland shooting signaled a crossroads where we had to choose between a civilized society and the wild West. For others, deplatforming and job lynch mobs are the sign a the crossroads. The strangest thing to me is that there's an apparent lack of crossover between the two groups. Why would deplatforming and school shootings be related in any way? I don't know the answer. That's what makes it funny to me."

The whole Twitter gab style social media is just stupid. You put up a post-it note and people respond or don't.

Even if they don't, taking ones similar to your major will help you when you take the corresponding college course.They're not a "scam" either. My friends took a few AP classes and it saved them a lot of time in pointless general education credits they make you take first year of college, or let them skip over beginner calculus courses and jump into the more complex stuff first year, which you can either leverage to graduate more quickly or have a lighter workload over the same 4 years."

Hard to know better when you’re conditioned on how important it is to go straight into college as a teenager, and all the media and guidance councilors at the time was romanticizing college life, too.I’d caution anyone from getting a masters degree until they have some experience (unless it’s a field where you NEED one to have a career).

e4zqe43;cblasfemia;1535513513.0;"I went into college with 8 or so AP classes that I scored a 4+ on and it didn't help because they only counted as generic credits and weren't acceptable as substitutes for Ged Ed classes, except for Calculus and Macroeconomics."
e4zdlux;SithisTheDreadFather;1535502720.0;"Yes, they accept credits. But they don't always go to the degree plan you're looking for. So glad I got a 5 in APUSH only to learn that it meant nothing and I would've been better off just taking a PoliSci dual credit class so I didn't have to pay for one at university.Edit: same with nearly everything else I took: World History, didn't need; English 3, didn't count; English 4, well I probably should've scored higher than a 3 my senior year; Calculus, too advanced for my freshman year and worthless for my degree. And yeah, I could've scored a 5 to get out of Chemistry or Physics, but I didn't.The takeaway was that I could've had a much less stressful high school and still got better credits easier and that actually pertained to my degree plan. The best part about AP was not having to be in class with the slobbering morons that I experienced my senior year when I took regular Gov/Econ. Holy fucking shit."
e4zjkmv;The_RedWolf;1535507768.0;"Sithis is right though, it is complete bullshit.  Just sticking with a common one, US History.  Only about 55% get a 3 or higher, so you can spend all that time and effort in the class, do really well in it and still end up with nothing.  This is especially true if the university you go to requires a 4 or 5.Yeah good fact of life lesson there, but it's all bullshit when you can spend that time in a dual credit class which is undoubtedly easier and get guaranteed credit that transfers everywhere with a C.I'm so glad I took nearly a full year of credit in DC.  The only AP class I took was World History and that class didn't get me anything despite getting a 4."

e4zjs7y;The_RedWolf;1535507943.0;"In Texas, they passed a law that all public universities are required to give credit for 3 scores if they accept that test.  So many got around this requirement by using 4's for their major specific version and 3 for a general version.  Like in Calculus AB a 3 gets you business calculus, 4 gets you the normal one.  In Calculus BC you have to get a 4 to get a full year which is the whole damn point, or a 3 for 1 semester.In Biology and Chemistry, 3 gets you non-science major science credit and 4 gets you the science major credits"

Just take them and shove them up your ass you dipshitSorry, second language, didn't got to school in the US. It sucks, because my sentences sometimes need revisions, but on the plus side, nobody ever shot at me at math class or a video game tournament. (I like that a lot.)One day, I'll be able to EPICALLY WRECK people with banter like "EAT SOME MORE GLUE RETARD" but till that day comes, I'll have to occasionally edit my posts, I hope you can live with it. I know I can. "

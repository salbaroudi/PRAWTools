e4m4r68;thermitegf;1534940356.0;"What makes iDubbbz a rage is when people say that something isn't a joke just because they are personally offended or don't think it's funny. He then explains the joke behind some of James Gunn's most offensive tweets by talking about how some of them are fake retweets written as a joke to make his friends look creepy, or are lampooning a popular hashtag of the time."

e4mlkpe;wolfsfang;1534969452.0;"Did he get into the backstory of it?Gunn said people should get fired for twitterjokes if they are offensive.Triggerd by rosannes hillarious zinger.https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3fc2c91ae41e8d067c49347e2a5677c4which people also claimed was not a joke.So they held him up to his standard.The its totally not a joke thing was a stronger element with rosanne. With Gunn it was a big cocktail of creepfactor with him joking about pedophilia nearly daily and attending a pedophila themed party in private etc.its interesting that he picks the one time the shoe was on the other foot to complain about it, when this has been going on for half a decade."

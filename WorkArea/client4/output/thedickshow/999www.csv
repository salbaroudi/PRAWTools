e4m6605;Hawkstream;1534942123.0;"Prediction: Maddox is going to sabotage his website, claim it was dick and his platoon of certified card carrying harrassers, and use that as an excuse to quit the internet persona biz. So it won't be his fault he quit, it will still be Dick's."
e4m3xva;Ashanmaril;1534939377.0;"No way this was Dick, he never calls Maddox "George." I'm thinking either a false flag by Maddox, or someone who actually managed to hack the site. I don't think Dick could even do this, he only has access to the iTunes feed."
e4m4pmk;DickMasterson;1534940301.0;"Whoa. Did anyone get an [archive.is](https://archive.is) of this?"
e4m93s8;SueLightningsPenis;1534946352.0;"Guys... six numbers... what else has six letters and is retarded?  >!E N I G M A!<"
e4m96rh;NumberEightySeven;1534946488.0;"http://madcastmedia.com/about/I real hacker wouldn't leave "Madcast is the best podcasting network in the unvierse". Maddox did this himself to play the victim, and he did it in the dumbest way possible."
e4m2wqa;AlexWyvern;1534938209.0;"Strange how the tagline, voicemail and Lost-esque "mystery numbers" are there. Almost feels like Maddox did it himself for attention/to troll."
e4m2auz;xxotaruxx;1534937548.0;"right as i sent this it went back to normal.. weird."
e4m3kfg;Spacemangspiff;1534938944.0;"This doesn’t feel like dick. "
e4mbhkh;WheresTheButterAt;1534950634.0;"I think Maddox has a drug problem."
e4mhwwf;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1534963949.0;"There are shenanigans here because the **copyright on Maddoxs site is 2018, not 16.** I still call it a false flag so Maddox can fabricate evidence against dick"
e4m3bq3;moosepajamas;1534938672.0;"This arc is getting kinda weird.  "
e4mec6h;ADuckingIdiot;1534956534.0;"571972 is there like a signature line.  It's also what the votes were all set to."
e4mgzqo;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1534962225.0;"This is a false flag by Maddox so he can cap it and use it in a new lolsuit as proof of dick "threatening" him.Inb4ing this. "
e4mpkgp;ras344;1534973862.0;"Maybe it's a date: 5/7/1972...The Grateful Dead Live at Bickershaw Festival?"
e4md109;rahzark;1534953707.0;"So this is the excuse he's come up with? "I was hacked"? Pathetic. He's such a dumb ass, anyone can see through his shit."
e4n0aqv;Demplition;1534983286.0;"Did anyone else see this? If not, I bet OP is just trolling with Inspect Element."
e4mb62m;j_rainer;1534950021.0;"I blame the Enigma. "
e4mmdzt;jahvidsanders44;1534970444.0;"I guess the freedom to file a lawsuit doesn't mean freedom from consequences."
e4nlqkg;lago-m-orph;1535000779.0;"not funny enough to be dick or a dickhead, looks fake and gay to me"
e4mcja2;dubb5ack;1534952680.0;"Assuming this isn't a false flag, too far, whoever did it.  "
e4n7kx7;joey_w69;1534989146.0;"False flag"
e4nl09p;im_not_a_racist_butt;1535000155.0;"Maddox was hacked like [this](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-false-flag-hacks/) was hacked."
e4nurz5;Bankrupt84;1535008786.0;"He doesnt even write articles for The Best Page. He is too busy being a Youtube Journalist"
e4p4y30;pitbulldeathsquad;1535067050.0;"I'm sure Dick isn't the only person Maddox ever pissed off. This is probably Mental Jess though."
e4mh3qc;plazyx1;1534962439.0;"I found the hacker. Pretty big balls on this one showing their face and mocking Madolf like that https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yPM6iaEx3VY"
e4msn5m;BenadrylPeppers;1534976801.0;"Seems to be back to normal?"

e4m80zt;SKRUZO;1534944684.0;"Then anyone looks at the FTP logs and sees that all edits were done by Maddox... He can't stop fucking up."
e4mjobz;AlexWyvern;1534966846.0;"My prediction is this, but he's going to tell his fans he was "hacked" by a mysterious hacker called 571972 who has been bothering him since 2016 to explain away the "stolen iTunes feed" and recent vote shenanigans (votes defaulted to 571972) to avoid confronting Dick.Or he's making up shit to paint himself as the victim for an upcoming #dicklies2.It sounds like fanfiction but it's suspicious how it disappeared after being posted here."
e4mml1i;rockfordphile;1534970676.0;"If anyone is old enough to remember Morton Downey, Jr. - the right wing Donahue from the 80's, he once staged it to make it look like he got the shit kicked out of him by skinheads in an SFO airport bathroom. Too bad the swastika spray painted on his face was on backwards because he did it while looking in the mirror. I'd love to see Maddox make a mistake like that, if this is what he's really doing."
e4mn9q6;RazorCandies;1534971452.0;"As long as he quits I'm good"
e4mwttr;FireballWhiskey26;1534980471.0;"This ending would actually not surprise me."
e4m60i0;Kyle_Belmont;1534941929.0;"He called him George once for the first time recently, so it's no longer a case of "never"."
e4ml5r6;Mrfish31;1534968921.0;"Almost certainly. The tag line the "hacker" uses is the same as the number of votes. Real spooky Maddox! Someone calling 571972 themselves is hacking you to mess with your vote scores! Except we already know it was you who nuked them you fucking idiot. This is clearly you trying to drum up something that doesn't exist in order to quit/blame dick more. Stop. "
e4m63ma;Spacemangspiff;1534942038.0;"Not you then eh?Maybe he did it to screenshot it to use as “evidence”?"
e4m4r4n;xxotaruxx;1534940354.0;"Ah shit. I didn't know about that. My bad. "
e4nhxsv;MyroomRecords;1534997616.0;"I 100% Believe he did it himself to justify the random number of votes and explain away the "stolen" iTunes feed."
e4mjda7;Ben2749;1534966380.0;""what else has six letters and is retarded?"​A retard."
e4mur9b;onetruepurple;1534978691.0;"What's a nigma"
e4m35ee;No_Nuts;1534938475.0;"Or to say Dickheads™ are hacking him"

e4mjb9v;AlexWyvern;1534966295.0;"If anything, more likely against Asterios due to the upcoming sanctions motion. (And for some reason he seems to hate Asterios more).2016 was when the break-up happened and Asterios was still working at WS. Also Asterios calls him George.While it's a stretch it's not something I'd put past him at this point, and it *is* funny how OP says the page switched back as soon as he posted it here."
e4ms3ji;TupVonButt;1534976299.0;"100% agree. The last time his site even had that layout was 2016, and even then the screenshot is missing the Stitcher and I-Tunes logo at the top right of the page as well as the episode numbers below the logo.&#x200B;[http://archive.fo/z0w6B](http://archive.fo/z0w6B)"

e4n28y2;Subsonic-Sparkle;1534984855.0;"This guy’s onto something."
e4n2fmj;tommy_twofeet;1534985002.0;"You might be right. Without an archive of it I'm going to have to take it with a table spoon of salt. The address bar is conveniently cropped out which is what makes me think this is fake. If someone saved the page and edited it later the address bar would show the location of the page on their drive. "
e4nm319;xxotaruxx;1535001071.0;"It's just weird that it was only up for like 10 minutes from when I first saw it. Makes me really believe he did it himself."

e4m62vy;Ashanmaril;1534942012.0;"Yeah but general rule is he doesn't. And he also wouldn't do it here. He's not trying to "expose" Maddox with his real name that's easy to find. Even in the hijack clip he recorded he called him Maddox"

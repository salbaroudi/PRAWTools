99n66f;AllahHatesFags;1535058030.0;"I don't know if anyone has ever heard of this one: you wait until someone leaves their house or apartment, then you go up to their door, jam some toothpicks in their door's keyhole, then squirt the super glue in there.  Break off the parts of the toothpicks that are sticking out.  Then find a place to watch their futile attempts to open their door."

e4p4w1a;dubb5ack;1535067002.0;"That's about as funny as just stealing $200 from them outright instead of them having to pay a locksmith.  "
e4p3f0p;ChaosCowboy;1535065760.0;"Another good prank is to dent all the panels and break all the windows on their car with an Aluminum baseball bat.Then find a place to hide and watch as they wig out over their damaged car.Lol what a funny prank"
e4p4k8v;Demplition;1535066729.0;"You can then take it a step further and burn their whole house down."
e4ow212;DoodSalamander;1535059016.0;"Thatâ€™s really stinkin mean."
e4owxnq;Phteven_j;1535059905.0;"Why do you need super glue for this? "
e4oxf1l;Phoen3tix;1535060376.0;"We took that prank a step further in high school for our senior pranks. We waited until nightfall and snuck in thanks to a broken door. We then proceeded to superglue the locks on every goddamn door in the school. Every single lock had to be drilled out and replaced as a result, and school was cancelled for a day. Never got caught, but I heard word that they were installing security cameras over that summer..."
e4pbdhy;kaizervonmaanen;1535072508.0;"Another funny prank is to kidnap someone's child and keep the kid for a week before you reveal that it was just a prank. Hahaha, just imagine the look on their faces. "
e4pd2z3;Thx4Snax;1535073909.0;"File police report, take off doorknob, soak in acetone for an hour, reinstall doorknob, find you, take off hands, soak in acetone for a week, have a little bit more trash to throw out this week, Tony!"
e4pb930;kaizervonmaanen;1535072407.0;"Hahaha, I can just imagine how they will freak out. "
e4p2mrd;AllahHatesFags;1535065088.0;"Obviously you should only do this to somebody you don't like."
e4ox4wf;tommy_twofeet;1535060103.0;"Yeah, just put the toothpicks in, break them and walk away. Or just fill the entire locking mechanism with super glue. "
e4p2lqn;AllahHatesFags;1535065064.0;"So the toothpicks stay in the keyhole and the lock is jammed forever."
e4qct6x;Tanuu_Walken;1535106824.0;"Cover the child in super glue before you give it back to the parents.  Then find a place to watch their futile attempts to embrace their child."
e4pw3m6;ChaosCowboy;1535089793.0;"as gay as OP is, you're even gayer for empty online hypothetical threats."
e4pw7u2;Thx4Snax;1535089900.0;"Sean, come on. This shtick is getting old."
e4pwwe9;ChaosCowboy;1535090530.0;"weak response. It's weird and not funny, nobody knows what you're trying to say here. "Sean"? What are you even talking about?Let me coach you on a little digital trash talking. You should have responded "You're gayest for blocking people", "You're gayest for rating reddit comments", or the obvious answer, "You're gayest for sucking dicks". I wouldn't have been able to come back from that, you would have digitally burned me worse than a [protesting monk](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_self-immolation.jpg/800px-Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_self-immolation.jpg) I purposefully left the window open for you, knowing you'd come back with some retarded, convoluted, half-assed post. And then I'd show back up and school you on schooling me.You got a lotta work to do, kid, before you can make it in the big leagues of being a complete cunt on r/thedickshow. Obviously I don't want to read your weird, weak posts that don't even mean anything, so you're getting the block for being a dumbass, but feel free to continue reading my posts for real, hard-hitting examples of how to burn dum-dums online, alienate everyone, and really upset people. Remember, even though I blocked you, I still believe that one day you, too, can be a real live jackass on the internet. Enjoy learning from my posts.EDIT: also, downvoted.DOUBLE EDIT: go ahead and reply to this, clown"

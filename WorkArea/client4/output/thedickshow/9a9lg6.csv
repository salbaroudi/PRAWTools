e4tr49a;Ashanmaril;1535256312.0;"It's so weird how these 2 are still working together. Neither of them benefit from it -- quite the opposite.Jesse is a constant liability for Maddox's precious "brand." He's much more offensive than Dick, and if Maddox thought Dick was driving women away from the podcast, I don't see how he can just turn a blind eye to Jesse's shenanigans.And for Jesse, I know for a fact he's very inspired by Sam Hyde/MDE, and wants to become a figure in that "internet edgelord" community. But he's attached himself to Maddox, a complete laughing stock by an increasingly large number of people. Metokur, EZ PZ, Dame Pesos, Drunken Peasants, Lowtax, Official Podcast, etc. -- all on record making fun of the guy. Yet he continues to double down with his devotion to the losing team. It leaves him with an almost non-existent target for his fanbase, people who are into bullying people for comedy but are fine with internet celebrities suing people for making fun of them.They're seriously both so much better off cutting ties, I guess it must just be hubris keeping them together at this point, with neither of them wanting to admit they made a mistake in their partnership."
e4u0yl7;CameronMcL;1535266426.0;"That was actually an interesting debate.Watching Maddox twist himself in knots to demonstrate why a person he likes should not be deplatformed while simultaneously arguing why someone he doesn't like should be deplatformed was quite telling to his character."
e4tqbn3;Qayden;1535255515.0;"Maddox' series of expressions is the best part. He shines up thinking he is being praised, then immediately goes into Saddox-mode when he realize he's been duped, then he forces himself to put up a smile again as to not lose face."
e4tqanv;AffirmativeNod;1535255485.0;"Please do not link to that shitfuck without warning"
e4tqffm;GADBabaganoosh;1535255619.0;""Intoolectual heavy-weight" shut it off."
e4tqolh;SueLightningsPenis;1535255876.0;"That kind of jab is as old as comedy and is hardly real mockery. Damn he looks like a cancer patient now though"
e4u67ib;DoodSalamander;1535272177.0;"I don't believe any of this for a minute. Nothing this shitbird ever does is without middle school level trickery."
e4whlme;azdoge;1535376099.0;"I thought they broke up. Did I imagine that happening?"
e4x5dsj;lazierbeam;1535412458.0;"Reddit cropped the thumbnail to say "REE ALEX JONES" which coincidentally is exactly how I picture leftists who are forced to hear the cognitive dissonance whenever they are reminded of him"
e4twwxw;DickMasterson;1535262232.0;"Jesse is bizarre. I told him to call into the show and talk about his "contract" with MadcastMedia early on. The guy then goes on this weird, emotional rampage against listeners and their families, and then he keeps doubling down on it. I figure he's got some kind of personality disorder--or whatever brand of fuckhead disorder Maddox has. He seems hell-bent on sticking with his initial bad and unfunny decisions no matter how unnoticed they go. I wish he could be turned into comedy, but he seems immune to it."
e4ts7rj;Qayden;1535257424.0;"Yeah, I think that's true. Jesse isn't very talented and only gets around 500-1000 views on his youtube videos, so he needs to free ride on someone. Maddox is desperate for shows for his failing network and has to accept anyone. The humor doesn't come from either of them being funny, but the situation of them being forced to endure each other. I mean, how did Maddox even explain to his black girlfriend that a guy just called someone a nigger on his network?"
e4tyql2;CXMetalX;1535264051.0;"This is very on point, thanks. "
e4unomf;waveofreason;1535293420.0;"> And for Jesse, I know for a fact he's very inspired by Sam Hyde/MDE, and wants to become a figure in that "internet edgelord" community. But he's attached himself to Maddox, a complete laughing stock by an increasingly large number of people. Metokur, EZ PZ, Dame Pesos, Drunken Peasants, Lowtax, Official Podcast, etc.Yeah, but by sticking with Saddox he is sort of being that "edgelord".  Not to suggest Maddox is that in the slightest, but sticking with the "villain" is in a way counter-mainstream.  It's a weak play to say the least and I don't think it makes one bit of difference.  The dude is boring.  His "edge" doesn't work in the slightest."
e4u8p2q;NumberEightySeven;1535274767.0;"Did Maddox say Alex Jones should be deplatformed on his show?"
e4twz6u;DickMasterson;1535262296.0;"Dammit! Those are exactly the kind of clips I could play on the show if Jesse wasn't so clueless."
e4uaq9o;FireballWhiskey26;1535276932.0;"Hahaha!"
e4tqe90;Qayden;1535255587.0;"He doesn't get any views through hooktube. Plus I did say it was on his own network."
e4tztcc;Qayden;1535265180.0;"The fact that it's such an old joke just makes it funnier that Maddox falls for it."
DELETED;NoAuthor;-1;DELETED;
e4wly3v;Qayden;1535384291.0;"Jesse keeps saying things that aren't true, then goes "ahahah i troll u" even though he probably should have done those things."
e4ul4ts;playr1029;1535289281.0;"I was critical of him and posted a thread mocking him over on r/madcastmedia. He ended up going through my Reddit post history and writing a bad review on my real life business. He made an entire show about it and even called into my place during business hours."
e4txdy7;Ashanmaril;1535262697.0;"I'll be honest, I think he's capable of being funny. He has some street interviews he did and there's some funny stuff in them. But he just alienates any normal audience he'd be capable of maintaining with being edgy for the sake of it and never admitting when he's wrong, similar to Maddox. It's like they think if they admit a mistake to their audience everyone will abandon them but instead they just come off arrogant by trying to spin things to make themselves always look right. No normal person wants to follow them in their mental gymnastics routine"
e4wrjm7;Lpup;1535396410.0;">I figure he's got sone kind of weird personality disorderNarcissism. Even the smallest slight is seen as worthy of nuclear level retaliation at all cost. It's probably why he still backs Maddox. Maddox blows smoke up his ass (like he does with everyone) and Jessie not only is incapable of seeing that he backed the wrong horse, he sees all those calling his bet a loser as a threat.Its why even when the guy trolls, its not very funny. He doesn't do it for the lulz, he does it cause he's mad. He also doesn't get how pulling the same "I doxxxed you I am a winner" thing gets old. >I wish he could be turned into comedyNever gonna happen. Guy is unfunny and not terribly bright. "
e4ut1mu;mothalick;1535304860.0;"She didn't think it was a big deal, she says it all the time."
e4txp86;Qayden;1535263013.0;"Yes, it does suck that everyone on madcast are sitting on a gold mine of maddox-stories but are too afraid, to stubborn or to boring to capitalize on it."
e4trqq3;AffirmativeNod;1535256943.0;"True. I suppose the thumbnail misinformed me."

e4unusx;lurkaderpasherpa;1535293730.0;"How on earth was he able to figure out your real life business through your Reddit posts?"
e4vbzmd;garretttf2;1535331551.0;"What episode?"
e4txux9;Qayden;1535263175.0;"He did one very funny joke were he talked about how Maddox' fanbase didn't have a name. The punchline was "I guess they're called dickheads now"."
e4u2zjd;DickMasterson;1535268652.0;"More correct. "
e4u71df;RazorCandies;1535273031.0;"Jeese is at least fun to watch in a car crash sort of way because the guy seems literally insane. Maddox is generally painful to listen to. A debate on plastic straws? How exciting "
e4twdjb;Qayden;1535261678.0;"Some guy here on reddit said I should "hooktube" it so I assumed it was to make it not get views."
e4uqbc5;avnavar;1535298592.0;"Someone must suck at shitposting"

98gfg7;HeyMisterWolfgang;1534668522.0;""

e4fvdbx;rhawklp;1534670949.0;"My wife worked at Lush, and most customer legit thought the big huge slaps were $8. They didn’t realize that was the price per 1/4 pound. There were many instances were someone thought they were buying $8 of soap only to find out it was closer to $100"
e4fukb5;iron_jayeh;1534670082.0;"Australia? That looks like lush font. My wife has dragged me there often enough to recognise it. "
e4g27ef;znaXTdWhGV;1534678872.0;"vegan soap."
e4g6dfi;koala_ambush;1534684634.0;"I knew he was talking about lush as soon as he started the story. Overpriced, stinky bullshit store. "
e4gmrq2;Bankrupt84;1534715658.0;"i love their soaps!!"
e4isn3f;jahvidsanders44;1534808411.0;"I used to go into Lush with my wife but I literally cannot breathe in there anymore. The unabated nasal assault in there is just overwhelming. It's like a used video game store that has an atmosphere of 60% air freshener to counteract the awful B.O. from the clientele. My wife swears by it though and to be fair does have great hair. My favorite thing though is that they claim to be all vegan and earth-friendly and all that jazz while all of their products are made from the same laundry list of man-made chemicals the cheap grocery store products use."
e4iucbq;Angel_Hunter_D;1534809887.0;"For all their bullshit scents and aggressive staff, I love me a shampoo bar when I'm travelling for work. Consistent soap and smells save me a lot of hassle and it fits in an old chew tin. Fucking perfect. "
e4fv1vf;Phteven_j;1534670605.0;"That’s just a loaf before they cut it. You aren’t meant to rub the loaf on yourself haha"
e4g2p7j;jibmob;1534679506.0;"Do people really rub the bar of soap all over their body? Any one consider the etymology of the wash cloth and wonder what it is doing in the bathroom? "
e4fvib6;Thy_blight;1534671103.0;"That's a case of "read the fucking sign" though. The price is retarded, but the customer is an idiot in that case. "
e4g0rvi;iamlovemonkey;1534677088.0;"I know that pain. My wife stopped going. She said they raised prices while lowering the quality. I'm just happy I don't have to go there anymore. "
e4fw867;Basherballgod;1534671876.0;"Definitely looks like Lush, the sign on the left in reverse is a Lush sign (and it says Lush)"
e4gaxje;TheChickOfDestiny;1534692776.0;"Kinda weird how many dudes on this thread know a store called Lush just by looking at it. Even weirder how many were excited to point it out."
e4fy3sf;Dirigaaz;1534673956.0;"Lush is all over the place in major cities. Saw them everywhere in LA and now everywhere around the Seattle area."
e4gt1fj;WheresTheButterAt;1534722571.0;"Ive never heard soap referred to as "a loaf""
e4gowrn;vAxAv;1534718251.0;"I was raised to use a washcloth, but when I grew up I realized I'd rather clean myself with soap than a moldy (impossible that its not) rag. I never understood the washcloth beyond MAYBE it helps get that hard to reach part of your back. Like schwon said, bar soap is the perfect shape. Why add a step?"
e4h8rbo;Ashanmaril;1534737915.0;"Of course they are, they're trying to buy a giant slab of soap"
e4gazu9;Xuju;1534692909.0;"Because it’s the place that boyfriends are dragged into and made to try out all the different stuff. We’re all victims, reminiscing."
e4gb47h;Jack-Browser;1534693161.0;"I was being dragged into Lush stores so many times, it isn't even funny anymore."
e4gsjsn;WheresTheButterAt;1534722094.0;"Once you walk in one the smell will never leave your brain. Even walking by might give you Post Traumatic Smell Disorder."
e4i6bne;DroogyParade;1534775772.0;"Yeah how do people know a pretty popular store in malls all across the country? In all seriousness I was also told about the store by an ex a few years ago. I still use their face and beard cleaner Kalamazoo. "
e4istny;jahvidsanders44;1534808572.0;"It's kind of hard to miss a store in every mall that assaults your sense of smell as soon as you step within 100 yards of one."
e4k3f3d;CivicPlaza;1534861040.0;"Never been but theres about a thirty little tubs with this font on it in every chicks shower"
e4fzzkh;juiciusmaximus3;1534676135.0;"Lush is in Canada too."
e4h03mg;Phteven_j;1534729392.0;"I don't know what to tell you. It's pretty common https://www.google.com/search?q=soap+loaf&oq=soap+loaf&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i60j0l3.941j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"
e4gsxzy;WheresTheButterAt;1534722478.0;"Fuck bar soap. Shit dries out my skin and leaves me feeling almost sticky.Dont you motherfuckers just use bodywash? Also loofah>wash cloth."
e4gr2ik;proAKA;1534720592.0;"Because if you spend $10, you can get large amounts of washcloths. You use one of them per shower. It is never moldy because you wash them in the washing machine between uses. Scrubbing things like your crotch and getting off the residual soap is much simpler and more thorough with a washcloth. Rather than adding a step, it makes the process quicker, easier, and more complete. People who don't use washcloths ought to try it for a week and tell me they don't like it better."
e4gbjlp;TheChickOfDestiny;1534694027.0;"I’ve never even heard of this place before. Sounds kinda cool though. I should try to drag a boy in one."
e4it0lu;jahvidsanders44;1534808739.0;"I use the dollar beard club shampoo for my hair and beard. It's way cheaper, smells like the forest, and is sulfate free."
e4g6fx3;koala_ambush;1534684739.0;"It’s in Japan, the UK, everywhere! Just stinking up all the malls. "
e4hf99n;WheresTheButterAt;1534744387.0;"TIL about soap loafs"
e4gcovr;foxtosser;1534696507.0;"There are hundreds in the UK. You can smell them from 50 yards away. They are hell.And they recently ran an anti-police marketing campaign https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fury-cosmetics-giant-lush-launches-12630982What connection do police tactics have to do with a soap company? Absolutely fuck all. "
e4hbhvb;wauterboi;1534740644.0;"If you are ever in Vegas, my wife will give you the tour. I'll be dragged along so you will have brought a guy in by proxy."
e4gbwkc;Jack-Browser;1534694765.0;"I think you would like it. The stores smell pretty good (because of all the product) and the stuff is usually hand made by the staff. Also the guy will be overwhelmed by the smells and you being eager to try the samples. He should be pretty docile once you are out of the store."
e4gjq8y;Mortotem;1534711451.0;"As a boyfriend whose been dragged into many chick stores, i gotta say lush is the best of them.      If i end up in Sephora or the like, I'm not allowed to touch anything. At least this place let's you fuck with their shit. "
e4gmv4f;Bankrupt84;1534715782.0;"and the soaps are naturally made and smell so good"
e4hdotf;TheChickOfDestiny;1534742832.0;"Thanks buddy"
e4gssne;WheresTheButterAt;1534722337.0;"Sephora is the worst place to get dragged. You just have to walk around and cringe at the price of everything.The whole time hoping that stupid bitch doesnt buy some 100 dollar set of make up brushes she will never use."
e4isxg0;jahvidsanders44;1534808662.0;"Dude, read the ingredient list once. It's mostly man-made chemicals. All of their shampoos are made with sulfates, which are horrible for your scalp and hair."
e4h8nlv;TheChickOfDestiny;1534737808.0;"Actually, nice makeup brushes are some of the best things to get. NICE ones. In fact, when men ask me for gift advice for a woman, this is my absolute first suggestion. Try it. Lmk how much she loves them later."
e4gucbp;Mortotem;1534723847.0;"She can buy whatever she wants. I spend money on games i play but probably won't beat, that's almost the same. "
e4jeme2;Bankrupt84;1534827025.0;"It definetely has chemicals in it to keep the products from turning to crap. Organic stuff degrades fast"

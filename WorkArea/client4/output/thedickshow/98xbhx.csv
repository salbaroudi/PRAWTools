e4jfqan;RazorCandies;1534827965.0;"Oh no. Where will we go to discuss the exciting content of Mundanematt?"
e4jfx92;AllahHatesFags;1534828138.0;"I don't think that guy even merits his own subreddit."
e4jj5ot;Ribonizer;1534831035.0;"It was so dead. the Reddit has never seen more activity than now.It was all Matt making a post about whatever Video he just shat out, And there would be no comments.I've never seen so many 0 comments posts in my life!"

e4jpjj1;SithisTheDreadFather;1534841145.0;"Is that even him? It looks like someone else's bot that just posts when an new video goes up, which it will dutifully do until it's specifically told not to (hosting goes down, someone changes code, etc). "
e4k4pd4;armoured_bobandi;1534863298.0;"I love how if you go to see his profiles, they have all been suspended.  I think Jessie got kicked off reddit finally "
e4jpsig;Asshole2Assholes;1534841807.0;"Oooh. That actually would make more sense. Still funny how its ONLY pod awful"
e4jrfum;SithisTheDreadFather;1534846408.0;"It's just funny that not even Madcast can be assed to post their own things on their own subreddit. Or, at least, there are no listeners willing to do so given Reddit's rules."

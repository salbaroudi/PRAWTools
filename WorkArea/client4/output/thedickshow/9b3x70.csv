e507k0f;SCShouter;1535528754.0;"...but Maddox said it was confirmed. I don't know about you guys but I'm starting to think this Maddox dude is a little dishonest"
e509xf5;BioDomeWithPaulyShor;1535531051.0;""Apple blocked my website! My site is most definitely NOT on a content block from some Net Nanny program every Apple Store is running."  "Penn Gillette actually apologized to me on Twitter for misrepresenting me in a decade old TV show! He totally wasn't apologizing to get me and my fans to stop bothering him and get on with my fucking life(Vote up Non-apologies!)  "I'm gonna be the host of a game show! With my natural charisma, bald fucking head and suit over T-shirt I'll definitely get on prime time TV, and this is very obviously not a money laundering scheme!"  For somebody who calls himself a genius and brought in Lesser Minds as a problem Maddox sure is bad at thinking even half a step ahead. What a fucking sap"
e50bkoz;huttbowl;1535532699.0;"The problem is that you forgot to check it in 2001.&#x200B;It was very probably blocked automatically because the homepage has the words: "shit, dipshit, bitch, ass, racist, asshole, dumbass and pissing"&#x200B;P.S. The real reason Maddox hates self-checkout lanes is that his article "[That's right asshole, bag my groceries!](http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=dumbassjocks)" is about him now."
e50bk0m;Tamrowski;1535532680.0;"Congrats to his host for finally correcting his content filtering categorization error"
e50a7o8;Linrraba;1535531374.0;"I believe he deep inside knows all those things just don't wanna acknowleged them. Remember that BPITU episode when he said he cure his own depression by refrasing his thoughts in a positive manner"

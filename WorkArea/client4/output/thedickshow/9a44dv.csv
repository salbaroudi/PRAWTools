9a44dv;TomTuff;1535199328.0;"Road Rage LA was unlike any other road rage, the energy was immense, HUGE. Do more of these shows, there are plenty of dickheads in the SoCal region. Standing room only.Call it something else since it's not on the "road", so that all of the midwest dickheads don't get mad. "

98srnv;teh_maki;1534793186.0;Anyone got theories on the number 571972?
98srnv;teh_maki;1534793186.0;"[Here's one.](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheDickShow/comments/987smw/whats_up_with_the_best_debate_voting_numbers/e4e2dgb/)Pretty easily can mean the date 5-7-1972 where it's either May 7 or July 5.It can also be:* [a shade of purple](http://www.color-hex.com/color/571972)* the sum of two squares 174^2 and 736^2* [a crashed plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_Air_Force_Flight_571)* the max limit for some number, but I don't know any programming language that has that as a numerical data type limit."

e4itnlg;tommy_twofeet;1534809289.0;"Guys it's his fucking xmission password. I just checked. Confirmed idiot. While hacking through his server I found various folders and sub folders that point to potentially damaging and illegal activity. There are 15 folders of various types of Cuck porn (ranging from soft to hardcore and even beastcuck porn....I don't want to know what that is).1 folder contains evidence that Maddox was actually responsible for 9/11. I found several email messages between him, Steve Jobs, and Bush Sr. I'll do more digging later but I think this is proof positive that Maddox is a cuck and a faggot."

Searching for "<box>ºD" in Google yields "The Devil Wears Prada" as the first result. Conclusion: Maddox is a faggot.4. Searching for "<box>ºD" in DuckduckGo yields "Hollister Elementary" located in Santa Barbara as the first result. Second result yields Despacito. Conclusion: Maddox is probably a pedo and is definitely a faggot."

e4jjprc;Xuju;1534831543.0;"I think it’s likely just an integer max to the voting numbers. It’s pretty likely he decided to input 99999999 votes on either side, and it capped out at an arbitrary number. What are the chances that Maddox is trying to tell anyone anything? He can barely think one step ahead, let alone two. I wouldn’t think there’s anything to it.I’ve seen integer maxes similar to this before, but nothing exactly like it. I seem to recall it was in Lua last time I saw a random integer max like that."

99d4nw;plazyx1;1534971672.0;It's still baffling that Maddox became such a prolific lolcow
99d4nw;plazyx1;1534971672.0;"Seriously, how do you go from trolling people who send you hate mail to this oversensitive manbaby?It's more pathetic than anything else."

e4mnnyw;ComradexSnarky;1534971892.0;""You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain." I'm still waiting on Maddox to realize just how fucked he became."
e4mo0a6;portuguese-charlie;1534972263.0;"Moved to LA, lost his hair, dated Mental Jess. There’s your answer."
e4mvswl;HammerTime3850;1534979616.0;"It’s Because he stepped into the limelight ... he portrayed himself as this badass pirate king and turned out to be the stereotype of what an internet troll looks like."
e4mo66t;Qayden;1534972438.0;"It blows my mind that a mere 4 years ago so many of us thought Maddox was the smart one of the two."
e4n6dg6;MatsuMuhou;1534988156.0;"In retrospect, the hate mail was an early sign of what Maddox was always really like. He couldn't handle the bants, so he sent his goon squad after his detractors. Sad."
e4mplhg;GEOTUS-fan;1534973891.0;"It's called living in Los Angeles.  Dick and Szechuan should get out before its too late."
e4mwodr;NIPO_de_Clown;1534980346.0;"It was always in him. Don't get me wrong, I was a fan of his until pretty far into TBPITU, but I remember back in the day he had this cringy feud with Something Awful, which is why Lowtax was laughing at Dick for having worked with the guy. It was a much smaller affair and it never gained much attention because of this and the state of social media back then. Still, it had some of the ingredients of the Maddox that has revealed himself since: being extremely petty, overly protective of his own work/reputation, and convinced that he was the first to do something, and kind of looking like a jackass because of it."
e4mx4a3;Tamrowski;1534980712.0;"I almost wonder if the hate mail was faked."
e4n05hb;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1534983169.0;"He was always the same people. The trolling of hate mail was an outgrowth of his oversensitivity. Thats why he drew cartoons depicting the people who sent him mail as KKK members and there's a length response to a piece of hate mail on the I Am Better Than Your Kids artwork. &#x200B;Its the same person, we just see him differently."
e4n7ojf;Colbeagle;1534989228.0;"When you get really engaged on twitter, it changes your brain.  The irony of him talking about filter bubbles, and then fully embracing one really led him down this path.  If you look at all of the non-maddox character stuff he's put out there, it's 100% twitter.Screenshots of tweets in the restraining order, the lolsuit, his FB cover profile.  Everything tweet directed to him gets him that dopamine hit.  Everything that isn't directed at him is a subtweet about him."
e4nagfx;dubb5ack;1534991489.0;"He thought he would be king forever.  He must have never thought far enough ahead to plan how he would respond if he ever got trolled back.  "
e4niwwh;Stiffalis420;1534998415.0;"IMO the worse thing Maddox has done/is doing is all the extreme progressive tactic bull shit. Calling people sexist, racist, rape apologists, etc to try to get people not to like someone. There is nothing more shameful than being the jealous guy who says "you shouldn't like that person, he's racist.""
e4o0r55;peets666;1535014481.0;"Remember how Dick was willing to chalk it all up to creative differences at first? The downward spiral from Maddox since then has truly been fucking astounding, but he could have avoided it all so damn easily."
e4my332;Gleeroy95;1534981497.0;"The JUST can come for any of us, let this serve as a cautionary tale"
e4n23kg;karnova;1534984732.0;"Oh I think he knows, but a combo of hubris and sentiment that the best solution is to just ignore it and keep moving forward will stop him from manning up and admitting he went full retard."
e4n5xip;Arcticfox04;1534987798.0;"After he moves back to Utah and becomes a Mormon he'll admit his errors."
e4mo81a;Qayden;1534972493.0;"The writing was on the wall way before that. Remember Maddox' Penn & Teller appearance."
e4mxav4;FireballWhiskey26;1534980863.0;"I don’t think so. Maddox always seemed to be this person. Look at his old articles. And I’m talking about the ones that aren’t a part of his “greatest hits”.They’re pretty jaded full of self-loathing."
e4msk2i;plazyx1;1534976725.0;"I always thought Maddox was a character, not actually some smug "genius" type.[This](http://thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=suicide_blame) or [this](http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=segway_more_complicated_than_it_needs_to_be) isn't actually funny if you think the author is actually saying profound shit. It's funny because it's mostly edgy shit, in this over the top self congratulatory way.  "
e4n46gy;UghImAWriter;1534986397.0;"yeah on biggest problem I thought he was smarter for about 5 episodes, then realized he was equally dumb, then discovered he was more dumb"
e4mq75d;plazyx1;1534974484.0;"They've lived there their entire lives. I think they're inoculated against the LA bullshit."
e4n3xny;HolidayHowlett;1534986202.0;"People thought he was Gol D. Roger. But nope, motherfucker was Buggy the Clown. "
e4n9oul;tefloncondom;1534990865.0;"He's said before that it was only the stupidest ones. I imagine anyone who made a good point were ignored outright."
e4n20ua;FireballWhiskey26;1534984670.0;"I don’t think he’s creative enough to come up with those sorts of conversations."
e4pcf0o;CivicPlaza;1535073363.0;"Anytime he mentioned facebook he sounded the way that guys who only think about football sound when they tell you about fantasy football in real life.Like he claimed women hate Dick Masterson just because there was a comment on his FB page from a girl saying she doesnt like Dick. Anytime he mentions social media it sounded like he did not think about anything else while awake, just his facebook and twitter."
e4o7079;kaizervonmaanen;1535020858.0;"Yes this. It would be completely different if he had accepted 'creative differences' (which means that the show ended because people didn't like each other anymore). Which was true. While his dicklies video where he made up these ridiculous lies did only hurt him"
e4nalem;dubb5ack;1534991602.0;"He doesn't just ignore it tho.  His MO is to block and go after people's jobs behind the scenes.  I'm certain we would just get bored and forget about him if he truly just ignored us and did nothing else.  "
e4montu;plazyx1;1534972952.0;"Yeah for sure. I remember when that aired I thought Maddox looked like a moron, and his explanation made sense, but now it's obvious that if they did take him out of context, they didn't need to do it much at all to make him look like a moron."
e4n96u9;tefloncondom;1534990459.0;""No spring chicken" I remember being mildly disappointed at this clip, but hearing Maddox give them shit and seem genuinely eager to meet them, not knowing they were doing their parts in a sound studio despite them being shown only in the studio for the entire series, never on location ever made me realize he's definitely not as smart as he thinks he is."
e4mwlmb;abaz204;1534980284.0;"I definitely remember losing faith in him being cool the first time I heard his voice, and losing way more the first time I saw his picture."
e4mz5jy;DickMasterson;1534982357.0;"This is true. Sean and I have friends who are not in entertainment. People trying to make it in entertainment in LA are deranged and consumed by failure, everything they do is some sort of transactional process meant to opportunistically propel their "career". They only have one another to turn to and you can see what it does."
e4n3xn0;MazInger-Z;1534986201.0;"Most people who grow up there know the score.  It's the people coming into it that are naive about the culture.They let it wreck them.  That's why MundaneMatt and Maddox are the way they are."
e4ms93v;apeshitdonkeydiq;1534976441.0;"Aren't they from Arizona?"
e4ndisg;Tamrowski;1534994006.0;"He also said Dick maintained a rape list and cooked the books "
e4nxl8x;karnova;1535011440.0;"How could I forget. Man he really is a chode."
e4myy8v;DickMasterson;1534982195.0;"I warned Maddox that they would do this and gave him very simple advice, "Figure out if they're going to make you the lunatic or the voice of wisdom very quickly and answer accordingly, they're just looking for sound bites, and remember...Penn and Teller ARE BOTH OLD." I also told him to secretly record the entire thing. He did not take this advice."
e4nf74s;hoodwink77;1534995370.0;"The best show in the universe ruined him for me."
e4n9irc;tefloncondom;1534990728.0;"I believe I heard Bill Burr talk about moving to LA only when he was an established comic."
e4mzrtk;Leftover3;1534982864.0;"When did Maddox move to LA? I watched his trailer on his youtube (him running besides kids and winning) and I thought that was well done and funny. When did the LA mind happen? Or was he always that way and I was a teen"
e4pgfb8;Hazencruz;1535076606.0;"that's why none of them will break rank with the constant anti-gop/anti-trump tweets. That and they will never get work if they do."
e4mx0eu;FireballWhiskey26;1534980623.0;"Sean has lived there his whole life I think.Dick grew up in Arizona. Not sure when he moved out to LA though."
e4ng1jb;tefloncondom;1534996059.0;"Good point."
e4mzp4h;Leftover3;1534982802.0;"And when he thought that Penn actually apologized to him. I wanted to rip my hair out. HE DOESN'T CARE"
e4mzvtf;tommy_twofeet;1534982952.0;"His take on Penn's apology now seems a lot more like an ego trip and less like a joke. Initially it sounded funny and not at all genuinely arrogant but after getting all this insight into how his mind works he just comes off like a complete asshole. Like, obviously Penn didn't remember him, he's not worth remembering. Maddox's video response (1000 years after the fact) now seems more like petty bullshit you'd expect from a teenage girl, not the internet's original Troll."
e4n44tq;UghImAWriter;1534986359.0;"He didn't listen because you weren't handsome enough and even though you are an expert in marketing and in fact a co-founder of one such digital company as well as having worked with other corporate entities before, you are still a stupid man who doesn't understand smart people stuff like "not looking like a dumbass on tv" and you were supposed to always play as his retarded dog-friend who never marketed a $30,000 website to him.Wait.."digital marketing"... "marketing"... could YOU be part of why Maddox recently brought in "Is Marketing Evil?" as a discussion on his dumb podcast??? (see: "Who Are These Podcasts" #113)Maybe not, because he then proceeded to talk about sales instead, and confused the concept of "marketing" with telemarketing sales and particularly "underhanded, manipulative salesmanship", and then proceeded to do a shitty commercial to market a worthless product and also to this day still talks about people's "brands" and being "on brand" (i.e....marketing)."
e4ng1nm;BenadrylPeppers;1534996061.0;"That was a pretty great time though."*That's* what he looks like?! No wonder he's never shown his face!""
e4n445t;MazInger-Z;1534986344.0;"Probably when he started appearing on TV.  No way they're gunna fly out someone like that.  Plenty of local crazy."
e4n4li6;Lpup;1534986731.0;"around middle school"
e4nwtls;IzzyNobre;1535010709.0;"> Maddox's video response (1000 years after the fact)I never understood for the life of me why he even bothered to respond. Didn't that episode air in like 2006 or something?"

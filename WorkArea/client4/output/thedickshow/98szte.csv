e4j2wbh;wauterboi;1534817163.0;"I think Gallagher went on a radio show and randomly complained about illegal immigrants. He also went on tour in Mexico without knowing anything of the language and delivered a strange, incomprehensible standup routine to a crowd offended by how poorly thought out the whole show was. Then again, that stand up description is based off of an editorial I read in the New York Times many many years ago. I can't really give a definitive review of his character."
e4j3dys;iamlovemonkey;1534817572.0;"Interesting, I know he and his brother had legal issues. Apparently his brother uses the name Gallagher as well (no issue there) but started using a lot of Gallagher's routine (sledge o matic, etc.) lawsuits happened, blah blah blah. I'm never sure which one is the real one. I saw Gallagher in Vegas years ago, but I'm still not sure if it was him or his brother. "

e4j1an4;juiciusmaximus3;1534815828.0;"Can she be charged with statutory rape?"

Don't go too far though, [don't believe all accusers now](https://mobile.twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/1031535197433602048)Edit: Also apparently a very odd link to [Anthony Bourdain and his suicide too](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/98pkhq/asia_argento_who_accused_weinstein_made_deal_with/e4iivcm/).

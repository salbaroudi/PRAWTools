99ije0;Doxmiplz;1535011540.0;"After long walk home from the Portland road rage, I am almost caught up. Hearing Dick go on about the medical field and nurses nearly gave me a seizure ( I am literally shaking right now). I worked in the San Fernando Valley as a EMT for 7 years and shit do I have some tales to tell, what is the best format for me to share them with my fellow dickheads?&#x200B;Edit: The first story people always want to hear is here :[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDickShow/comments/99jyaa/my\_taste\_of\_medicine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDickShow/comments/99jyaa/my_taste_of_medicine/)"

e4ovr6e;AllahHatesFags;1535058699.0;"It's only going to get worse because they are trying to phase out opioids.  Imagine going to the hospital with a broken femur and all they will give you is tylenol because they assume you might be or will become an addict."
e4sui8l;Skrongman;1535214113.0;"A few things from that rage;- The nurses are REALLY concerned about you taking opiates, because most don't understand them at all. Despite being told from day one that a patient's self-reported pain levels should be taken as gospel, they are all shit scared that everyone will develop a tolerance and end up a junkie (not unheard of, but really not that usual). If the doctors are rotating analgesics as they should be, things will be fine. I currently work in drug and alcohol, and we have patients go in to hospital for surgery, and the staff are worried about giving them pain relief because they might get addicted. Motherfuckers, they are already addicts, and their maintenance treatment is just that, maintenance. Give the poor pricks something for the pain, they're not going to morph into super-addicts.- Dick talked about dignity, and both guys described hospitals as chop-shops. Yeah, that's true, but they kind of have to be. I won't go into all the studies which show that patients who recover at home have better outcomes, and putting aside the risks of nosocomial infections and all that shit, yeah, you're going to be treated like meat, for the most part, and then fucked off home to recover. If you have something that can be cured by trimming some of your meat off, we are going to do it, so that you can go back home to your family and friends and continue to be a human. There is nothing more frustrating than having an obese, 40-something year old woman with a family history of heart disease come into your clinic with chest pain, and refuse to take her top off for an ECG because you are a male nurse and will see her nipples. Excuse me, ma'am, but I generally find my sexual partners on a night out, not lying semi naked on a cold table with electrodes attached to their chest. I also like ones with a longer life expectancy than you, and a lower BMI. If you have a legitimate issue, please put aside your pride, because not only are we not interested in your tits, we want to save your life, even if only so we don't have to meet to Coroner.- Medical miscommunications and patriarchy; fuck no, but also yes, communication is a massive problem for a different reason. From day one at nursing school, I was constantly bombarded with reasons why doctors were scum. Believe it or not, most of these anecdotes involved food...- Nurses should never, ever, fucking ever diagnose anything. They don't have the experience, the knowledge, or the right to do so. Fuck that nurse. "

e4sthzz;Skrongman;1535211861.0;"I'm a nurse, and I hate nurses. I did a Master of Nursing when I was in my 20's, and wouldn't trust 99% of my 220-strong cohort to take my blood pressure, let alone do anything more invasive. A couple of the many highlights of my interactions with colleagues include one student who had a 20 minute argument with my friend swearing blind that the heart only has two chambers, and a practical session on urinary catheters where approximately 5 out of 20 (female) students inserted the bulb directly into the vagina...Still, my absolute favourite memory of school was my first practical, where I was sent to a geriatric ward. The RN I was assigned to basically immediately told me to fuck off, because she had gone to dinner instead of preparing her medications on time for the evening round, so I was sent to do obs on a 6-bed room. The first patient I ever interacted with was a wizened old woman called Beryl, slight dementia, approximately 85 years of age. Sounds sweet, right? Well, I walked up to her bed and started introducing myself with the spiel we were told to remember, and she interrupted me with "what the fuck do you want?" Beryl was also the only person who ever removed a temperature probe midway through a reading to call me a "cocksucker", which she did multiple times on my fortnight there.The best exchange with Beryl, though, was when another male staff member and I went to turn her over so she wouldn't get bedsores, and the exchange went as follows;Beryl; "Oh look, two fucking faggots!"Male RN; "But which of us is the bigger faggot, Beryl?"Beryl (pointing to him, and speaking with vitriol); "YOU ARE!"I honestly miss that old bag. Best patient ever. Dead now, I suppose, the poor old cunt."

His buddies, one with a broken collarbone and one with a broken ankle AMAd. It’s interesting seeing how different people handle pain. Look up rodeo ‘bull balls’. That’s how this guy got bust up."

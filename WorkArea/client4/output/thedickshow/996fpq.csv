e4l9rdw;TheChickOfDestiny;1534910515.0;"So spicy, yet so sweet."
e4l9tpt;Dickheadsauce;1534910569.0;"I'm gonna miss that account. It was hilarious to see a bunch of people jump on him every time he replied to Dick or Nick. Tito will have to try another strategy to finally defeat the evil Dick Masterson and Nick Rekieta. "
e4l9su5;AlexWyvern;1534910549.0;"Mistaken if you think they won't just make an alt "
e4lbumq;MatsuMuhou;1534912257.0;"What? Twitter actually banned someone who deserved it? Unthinkable."
e4lkc9d;Spacemangspiff;1534919669.0;"Ayyy finally "
e4lqhv4;bionic86;1534925729.0;"Did people have any idea who it was? I'm guessing it was Jesse given the most recent purge seems to be going after people that circumvented bans."
e4n5cwd;Zenyeta;1534987343.0;" I came"
e4m95o1;wauterboi;1534946437.0;"Some of the people that replied should have considered not feeding attention instead"
e4la90o;Grand_Admiral_C;1534910927.0;"Upvoted just for the flair. "
e4m971m;wauterboi;1534946500.0;"So we just report again. This person is actually stalking and harassing Nick so..."
e4m93w3;wauterboi;1534946356.0;"I was surprised and delighted. People like this don't belong on any platform"
e4m93as;wauterboi;1534946330.0;"I reported the person's tweets and got the response that they were exhibiting abusive behavior"
e4mbxsy;AlexWyvern;1534951497.0;"Probably Tito"
e4mt39h;Dickheadsauce;1534977208.0;"Yeah that's true. Feeding trolls is a guaranteed way to keep them around. "
e4mbegj;AlexWyvern;1534950468.0;"Eh, don't play their games. He's a big boy, he can take care of himself."
e4n62gq;downvote_syndrome;1534987909.0;"I did it too, because they were....the entire purpose of the account was to harass Rackets."
e4nva43;bionic86;1535009251.0;"Anybody got a big computer we can use to confirm?"
e4mwy7i;wauterboi;1534980571.0;"In this case I think it's warranted because they're trying to invade his personal life and relentlessly bother them about it. The only reason they can't bring up much is because they suck at doxxing otherwise they absolutely would."
e4n8b3c;wauterboi;1534989737.0;"Yeah. Regardless of whether or not they were trying to be funny or troll they were still stalking and harassing Nick. It wasn't just zingers and mean tweets that are part for the course."
e4nv84n;bionic86;1535009201.0;"Interesting.. taken individually, I never really saw anything bannable in any of his tweets, but when you look at the history, it's pretty obvious it's a burner account for harassment. The fact he also reported everyone he was harassing probably didn't help."
e4nw51n;downvote_syndrome;1535010057.0;"Yeah if you scrolled through the timeline it was Nick's black costume. Over. And. Over. He'd just jump into whatever conversation Nick was having  and start posting it."

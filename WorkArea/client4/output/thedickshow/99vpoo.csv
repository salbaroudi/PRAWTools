99vpoo;karnova;1535128577.0;"Hey I‚Äôm going to make this short and sweet I‚Äôm leaving Reddit. I know you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äúliterally who?‚Äù and I don‚Äôt blame you as I never much of a presence but I signed up for Reddit after The Biggest Problem ended and I‚Äôve been commenting on here ever since.I‚Äôm writing this because I‚Äôve been wanting to quit for a while and making declarative post will help me to follow thru. Simply put I waste too much on the Reddit mobile app when I could be doing something more constructive like read a book or just play video games. And by deleting the App I‚Äôm done with Reddit because the current incarnation of the Reddit Desktop Website is a fucking bloated mess.This isn‚Äôt goodbye, I‚Äôll still be listening on the show and active on Discord. Speaking of which if you want to talk Star Trek and Sci-Fi with fellow Dickheads please visit Quarks on Discord: https://discord.gg/UDwxKTEnough navel-gazing, thank you Dick Masterson for making the best Podcast in the Universe. Reddit go fuck yourselves."

e4r15ev;Sofa_Man;1535144732.0;"I use Reddit instead of Facebook to avoid garbage posts like these. But you've managed to bring that cancer here. Get raped."
e4r829g;Builtro;1535151417.0;"Why do people always list reading books as a constructive thing to do? It might even be less constructive than video games!"
e4r6i9x;MaybeIAmAFuckinIdiot;1535150071.0;"Get fucked."
e4rarog;grimandfrostbitten;1535153719.0;"Just do the thing, don‚Äôt talk about the thing. "
e4rhjrd;Family-Duty-Hodor;1535159383.0;"Honestly, what do you expect anybody reading this to take away from this post?"
e4r3t7x;Phteven_j;1535147561.0;"> more constructive> playing video gameslelsee you soon bb"
e4r7zgh;Kravixon;1535151353.0;"Bye!"

e4qrr5y;karnova;1535129422.0;"Only gonna reply to comments in this thread then I‚Äôm done."
e4rhv7y;SnakeJerusalem;1535159650.0;"No to mention that just because something is a book does not mean it isn't garbage and cancer."
e4qry86;Trenny_jr;1535129840.0;"Keep telling yourself that, I  understand the desire to cut back but going cold turkey with these kind of things does not work. You need a new obsession to take over for instance a new game or something. Try this instead don't keep your phone on you in your home do other things use your computer etc that way you still satisfy your reddit needs but cut back significantly. "
e4qsi53;Pendacan;1535131038.0;"This thread will never end."
e4qtdyl;AffirmativeNod;1535132927.0;"You can also try God or heavy drug abuse."
e4qt80b;karnova;1535132576.0;"I hear you man, and cutting off an internet addiction in general will be much much harder perhaps impossible. But removing this app will be easy.Truth be told it wasn‚Äôt The Dick Show board that ate up unnecessary time. I noticed I could easily zone out and just look at that damn popular tab filled with mindless stale memes and amusing animals pictures. I felt my brain was getting smooth as I mindlessly stared at Doggo posts.Edit: I‚Äôve now deleted Reddit off my phone. GOODBYE. üçÜ "

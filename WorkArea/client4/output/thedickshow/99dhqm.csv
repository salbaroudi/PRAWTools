99dhqm;dyer47904;1534974537.0;"I think we need to consider the possibility that Maddox is the greatest comedian the world has ever known. It just seems improbable that anyone could be as consistently and epically stupid as him. Isn't it more likely that he is a secret comedic genius, and that he has made himself a sacrificial lolcalf, sacrificing himself on the altar of comedy that we might be entertained? Every day we come on here and talk about how it just doesn't seem possible. Perhaps it is not.Thank you for your sacrifice Maddox. For being the lolcow that we deserve, as well as the one we need right now. And also for the snacks. "

e4mxgm0;FiveSmash;1534980991.0;"He's truly the Tommy Wiseau of washed up comedy writers: amazingly bad to the point of hilarity and fascination. Is there some self-awareness lurking in his psyche? We may never know. But probably not."
e4mt9xx;BrassHockey;1534977377.0;"It's pretty remarkable.   Often over the last year or two, I found his funniest material to result from his most serious efforts.  He's now the [Basil Fawlty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlE47GckHRA) of podcasting.  Completely unable to adjust to the situation as it unfolds.  &#x200B;"
e4n0t0d;SnakeJerusalem;1534983693.0;"The big difference is that nobody loves his content in a so-bad-it-is-good way."
e4n9idj;Xuju;1534990719.0;"Except Basil was funny in his meltdowns. Maddox isnâ€™t even as good as Chris-Chan in that regard. "
e4nx8tq;ChaosCowboy;1535011108.0;"That's the trick. Maddox pours hours and hours of work into content that nobody watches as a red herring to convince everyone he's not doing this on purpose."
e4o76tb;jibmob;1535021054.0;"The not really Mexican insta meme is killing it "
e4ncjt0;BrassHockey;1534993203.0;"It's as funny as Maddox has been in years even though he's trying to be totally serious.  "

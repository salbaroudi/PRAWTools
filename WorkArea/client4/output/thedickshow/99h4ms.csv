e4o1c9p;cad_an;1535015030.0;"I actually have found a vulnerability in his site...I was gonna DM him to let him know how to fix it but he has me blocked. Never even tweeted him before."
e4nlst8;SnakeJerusalem;1535000830.0;"Didn't Dick said he was pulling less than a thousand downloads per week?"
e4o5xz1;IzzyNobre;1535019672.0;"Wait wait waaaaaitThe screenshot I saw earlier, something about his site having been hacked, was some sort of false flag...? Is that how he's explaining the feed hijinks?"
e4nq0m9;DrunkGrapist;1535004446.0;"5,000 weekly downloads isn't that bad actually, no? I think to monetize a podcast you need 1,000+, so that's not a bad number. Who are these 5,000 people?"
e4o6jmc;tlorea;1535020362.0;"Back to how much I rule..."
e4nsk9w;IvhL;1535006733.0;"Nice, wish it was live though :("
e4rcn6o;hoardingelixirs;1535155284.0;"Looks like someone hacked your account, savestatecorrupted"
e4nxket;NextBiggieThing;1535011419.0;"this is kinda gay"
e4ojxnv;Argorash;1535038979.0;"How can someone be running websites for as long as Maddox not keep their site from getting hacked? Did he have an accident a few years back and become retarded? "
e4o863u;MyroomRecords;1535022099.0;"Unblocked and DM'd in 3..2...1..."
e4o63my;Spacemangspiff;1535019869.0;"Lol"
e4nm4zg;MyroomRecords;1535001117.0;"That was just on iTunes. total reach I aggregated between that and his social blade stats is roughly 5000 but a topper autist than me could probably do a better stats."
e4o7pc7;MyroomRecords;1535021599.0;"That's the only logical explanation I can think of. Why else would the random numbers of the vote total that we KNOW he set be in the message? Also why would the "hacker" leave the phone number and email address on the hacked page? It's literally the next line down in the source code. "
e4oa4wq;SinCityAttorney;1535024283.0;"Maddox never changes. This is Heather 2.0, and it'll be exhibit A in his lawsuit against Dick in California. "
e4nwjq6;IzzyNobre;1535010448.0;"> I think to monetize a podcast you need 1,000+There is no set number for that, really."
e4nvwry;Mr-Scurvy;1535009841.0;"It's not great... There are very obscure podcasts out there about pocket knives that get 10k downloads an episode. "
e4nqrk2;MyroomRecords;1535005113.0;"His official number is 55,000 on the website. I was being generous in my edit and including video watches via his social blade stats."
e4ntfdg;Elcamo123;1535007526.0;"I download directly from the Dickshow website or Libsyn. I can't be the only one that does that so I imagine if you combine with Google Play, iTunes, or whatever else, it would add up to quite a bit. "
e4nmf8d;SnakeJerusalem;1535001359.0;"If his net-total reach is indeed 5000 downloads, that does not sound that bad to me. Granted, Dick pulls considerably better numbers than that, but is 5000 really that pathetic?"
e4noq0g;Basherballgod;1535003317.0;"That was a surprise to see how low the iTunes feed was."
e4ntb3v;kilam525;1535007418.0;"Did you check his SoundCloud account? He gets a few thousand downloads there. Normally it gradually declines (roughly 7,000 now), but he got a random surge of downloads for Ep 112 (a staggering 9,800)."
e4nwh9x;ChaosCowboy;1535010381.0;"Who is the toppest autist? Let's just go straight to him."
e4o6c08;armoured_bobandi;1535020133.0;"So where do we sit?"
e4p3lfs;carl_dood;1535065911.0;"If his claimed download numbers at the beginning of each episode are true, he is averaging between 25,000-35,000 downloads per week. That seems like it can't be accurate."
e4oloab;creadishcread;1535042544.0;"Yeah, it's whatever people are willing to give you.  With patreon you can get by on a few hundred listeners if they all love you enough to chip in some good money to keep you going.  Unfortunately most of Maddox's 'fans' hate him, and the feeling is mutual."
e4ohkqx;boedo;1535034656.0;"Yeah but theyâ€™re pretty sharp. "
e4nr2wp;DrunkGrapist;1535005395.0;"How many does Dick have? Didnt he mention 2500 weekly? But I think that's iTunes only right?"
e4nnuh2;MyroomRecords;1535002563.0;"considering that the number I edited was 55,000 weekly downloads, yes, that is pathetic in comparison."
e4nrcrw;Teddybearsyrup;1535005639.0;"If I started a podcast and had 5000 listeners I'd be pleased as punch but I'm not a formerly important internet personality and also have a source of income. If Maddox wants to not starve he needs more than 50000 listeners and more bonus episodes. BPITU money wasn't even enough to be an income"
e4nmuli;JMC266;1535001727.0;"Is that counting people who were still subed to the TBPITU feed and just not listening to TBD? Inactive accounts?"
e4nxy63;Spork_Of_Doom;1535011787.0;"Considering that Maddox is one of the first Internet celebrities, it's pretty fucking sad."
e4ofawc;tumeke4u;1535030940.0;"It's only pathetic when you consider that he used to pull 50000"
e4ntjk1;MyroomRecords;1535007635.0;"Since all his feeds are direced to SoundCloud. That's probably the most accurate number but let's be real. A good chunk of those are hate listens."
e4o17zp;Pilx;1535014915.0;"I wouldn't out it past Maddox to listen to his own podcast 9,799 times to boost his numbers.."
e4ocei9;NumberEightySeven;1535027002.0;"If he has an average of 7000 weekly downloads, and that's being generous, then at 115 episodes, he has less than one million downloads. The episodes before Xioan left were more popular, that could probably push it up to one million. Where does this bald cuck get off saying he has 3.5 million downloads. He must be counting all the downloads from The Biggest Problem and adding them to The Best Debate."
e4oj2p5;Stiffalis420;1535037301.0;"yeah, Maddox (I think) was averaging about 900 downloads from itunes and Dick is averaging about 2500 from itunes. "
e4o8q22;abaz204;1535022701.0;"Totally, and at least a few of his youtube views are just me going on there to downvote"
e4oj0o6;Stiffalis420;1535037200.0;"He probably had A LOT more listeners in the beginning... But still, I have questioned 3.5 million downloads"

9a3r7o;Fredselfish;1535195676.0;"Dick you and Shean watch Goonies and since I was not able to watch live I ask if you would have a recorded version for me to download.  Well when do I get it? I don't want to wait weeks. I think paying 10 bucks a month should entitle me to a little more. So please drop the recorded version so I can enjoy it.  Thank you."

e4tgffj;boedo;1535245683.0;"Isn’t the whole point of it to watch the movie?"
e4v38nc;Fredselfish;1535322488.0;"Yes and No. I remember Dick mentioning they are great without even watching the film. So I try it and he was right they are great even without watching.  Kept me from actually having to watch that fuck up Ghostbusters movie at all. The rest I have seen thousands of times so I didn't need to watch along to enjoy. I usually just watch the film then listen to my Dicktion. "

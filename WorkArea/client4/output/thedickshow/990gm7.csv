990gm7;huttbowl;1534857835.0;"Maddox brings up fucking Hugo Boss designing Nazi uniforms during the latest episode.  0% chance he knew that shit two weeks ago.[https://youtu.be/wUNK9jbcWbw?t=20m22s](https://youtu.be/wUNK9jbcWbw?t=20m22s)"

e4k47xh;NumberEightySeven;1534862417.0;"I thought it was common knowledge, at least to WWII history buffs, that Hugo Boss designed the Nazi uniforms. However, Maddox is an idiot and a $20 Patrioni, so he probably stole Xwing's bit."
e4kmygp;BioDomeWithPaulyShor;1534891404.0;"I love to shit on Maddox, but I distinctly remember them talking about Hugo Boss designing the SS uniforms on Biggest Problem, though I'm blanking on the exact episode. Something to do with Dick exclusively shopping at Hugo Boss and then Volkswagen profiting during WWII. This is gonna bother me all fucking day. Also there is no goddamn way that Maddox doesn't listen to TDS, if there was an incredibly successful podcast that shit on me for being an idiot you'd bet your ass I'd be listening to it every week."
e4k2ckb;karnova;1534859331.0;"Yeah I knew about the Hugo Boss thing and my knowledge of WW2 basically amounts to High School and TV."
e4k6tkg;CuntleberryFinn;1534867539.0;"Boss become a member of the NSDAP to tie business connection with the Nazis. He also used some slave labors and you can find nasty quotes. So he choosed to be a part of it.But it was a small company which produced working clothes and not stylish high fashion stuff at that time. Boss probably didn't design the SS uniforms, but some SS propaganda officer or else, some facts just get lost.Over time the whole story somehow shorten to Boss designed them.tl;dr: -Boss manufactured the Uniforms, together with many other factories at that time-Boss most likely didn't designed themEdit:>By the third quarter of 1932, the all-black SS uniform was designed by SS members Karl Diebitsch (artist) and Walter Heck (graphic designer). The Hugo Boss company was one of the companies that produced these black uniforms for the SS. By 1938, the firm was focused on producing Wehrmacht uniforms and later also uniforms for the Waffen-SS.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Boss"

e4k1sd4;Basherballgod;1534858476.0;"Listened to the full episode and his “co-host” and Maddox describes the exact way Shauvaugn dresses and how it is hot to women. Black shirt, jeans. "

e4k89g4;NotTooGoodBitch;1534870591.0;"In other WWII history buff news: Bayer used Jews for slaves and human experimentation, America had internment camps, and Hitler had a funny mustache."
e4lh9gn;Duocyun999;1534916834.0;"To me, it's the timing, not the information that is convenient. Xaqn brings it up and then maddox happens to have it on his mind is too much of a coincidence."
e4kebv5;SueLightningsPenis;1534881670.0;"There's no way he just happened to bring it up completely randomly a week later. "
e4kzjcu;tronfonne;1534901935.0;"Do people not know this?"
e4lr586;Cancer-Cinema;1534926386.0;"Dick shops at Hugo Boss?! I was hoping he was more of a refined Brioni Gentleman. Seriously Hugo Boss is trash."
e4m1byf;TheLeastCreative;1534936546.0;"Searching the TBPITU transcripts, the only mention of Hugo Boss was in episode 33, and it seems to be unrelated... Which is odd, I feel like I distinctly remember that too. Maybe it was a TDS episode?"
e4k8nvj;kaizervonmaanen;1534871457.0;"This, it is a fairly interesting piece of trivia so I have seen it mentioned many places and many times. "

e4k8wew;karnova;1534871958.0;"I like the story of Fanta Soda, when America formally entered the war communication and trade between Coca-Cola America and Coca-Cola Germany dropped. The head of Coca-Cola Germany continued production but eventually ran out of Coke Syrup, so he started making a Fruit Based Soda made of Apple Fiber, named it Fanta (short for Fantasie = Imagination in German). After the war he handed back to Coke factory to Coca-Cola and the rest is history."

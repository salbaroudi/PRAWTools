e4toccs;Linrraba;1535253485.0;"Just this week i read some chick lost a internship at nasa because she used swear words on twitter. I think the only solution to it is we collectively stop using any form of social network (or at least facebook and twitter) then focusing in using internet for its actual purpose : piracy."

e4truio;SithisTheDreadFather;1535257050.0;"Well, she did tell the respected former NASA engineer [Homer Hickam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Hickam) to "suck my dick and balls," and then a bunch of furries mass reported his account, got him suspended, and then harassed him so much after it was reinstated that he went private. You may have heard of him from the '99 movie "October Sky." People should probably stop using social media all together, but in the mean time it's probably unwise to insult a respected former employee and council member straight to his face.Note: He allegedly did not request that she be removed, and allegedly he attempted to get her reinstated. So do keep that in mind."

She also revealed where she was going to be interning at.If you were responsible for hiring and you're getting thousands of notifications filled with insults and expletives stemming from an incoming intern, well, I'm not a HR, so maybe a HR can key me in on what they'll do then."
e4tz8k3;Linrraba;1535264577.0;"I read that also but i'd side with her anyway . If i were excited about getting something i'd not be saying "golly gee sweet lord" but "fuck yeah,motherfucker". I'd also not be ok with some random person i've never heard telling me to watch my mouth. I'd definitely tell him to fuck off and let me gloat in peace. And i highly doubt he hadn't had anything to do with the cancelation "

e4u3bfg;Bottleroach;1535269013.0;"Welcome to 2018 where your social media behavior will impact your employment. Why should the degenerate furry be treated any better than anyone else? People lose job opportunities because they have a party photo as their profile picture. And whoever handles the hiring/this internship program at the Johnson Space Center got well alerted about this without needing Hickam's input because the furries tagged related social media accounts to the thread.Point is there are thousands of others that can replace her. There are plenty of candidates out there that will actually cherish this opportunity, and aren't surrounded by people flooding you with messages akin to "Please embalm my fursuit with your cum, Daddy!""
e4u3lho;Linrraba;1535269312.0;"Im totally aware of that fact and im expressing my desagreement with it.  The nasa guy brought that upon himself when he tried to be the moral police. Dude should be minding his own business."

e4u5nl5;Bottleroach;1535271586.0;"How dare we expect prospective interns to have a level of decorum and professionalism? Sure, a one-word tweet is starting drama and incredibly invasive. Let's ignore the thousands of notifications of vile messages getting spammed to NASA-related social media accounts stemming from this one furry."
e4u5vs9;Linrraba;1535271834.0;"I'll give you this: if this nasa guy had approach her privately and explained why she should not behave that way then he would be right. The way he did, though, putting her own blast, caused all the drama. As i said before i totally see her side of the story and i understand her overreacting. "
e4u7ov2;Bottleroach;1535273707.0;"Is this furry a queen to you? Yeah, Hickam should have contacted some random furry privately. Hickam shouldn't have put her "on blast" with a **one-word tweet**. The amount of care and respect you think she deserves and is entitled to is nauseating."

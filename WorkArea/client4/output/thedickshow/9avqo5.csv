e4ywmlm;McJaeger;1535485981.0;"Is this the time limit he has to serve you? What if you just spent the next two days in hiding to avoid it?"
e4yxpfb;buckshot_billings;1535487427.0;"The moon from Majora’s Mask looks a lot like Maddox!!!"
e4yxu70;brobafett1980;1535487603.0;"Service would be on Greenburger, since he represents Asterios."
e4yy751;crazytom57;1535488053.0;"with asterios as skullkid and Dick as the mask salesman"
e4z3atp;asterioskokkinos;1535493570.0;"Yes, I think he would then efile through the court computer system. He could literally have a new lawyer send it on August 29th at 11:59pm. His team did lots of last second drops earlier in the trial."

e505p52;asterioskokkinos;1535526995.0;"Yes! But there were also at least a few 9pm pre-deadline drops. I believe it’s standard legal practice to wait until the last moment bevause you don’t want to file, then have new info roll in that would have affected what you filed."

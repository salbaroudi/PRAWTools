98slg5;Ben2749;1534791386.0;Dick should change the logo for the old feed back to "Biggest Problem in the Universe", and put out a PSA that explains what Maddox has done.
98slg5;Ben2749;1534791386.0;"That will get the attention of Maddox's listeners, as many will be long-time fans of BPitU. As it currently stands, if they randomly see TDS in their list of feeds, they may not be inclined to listen, and may even unsubscribe entirely.This seems like a good way of getting the attention of people who may not have heard Dick's previous message, but may still be subscribed to the old feed.I suspect Maddox still has fans who aren't aware of what he's done. Trying to reach as many of them as possible will hurt his listener numbers.Maddox also can't claim copyright infringement, as Dick has just as much a claim to BPitU as he does."

e4ie65t;PersonMcGuy;1534792039.0;"Also upload all the uncucked episodes so people can see Maddox for what he really was."
e4igxoa;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1534796286.0;"Step 5 of the Dick Masterson plan to screw over Maddox is to somehow gain control over all of the Biggest Problem, and restart it with Asterios and release it on Thursdays."
e4if40i;CXMetalX;1534793596.0;"I agree. The bumper for the 113 episode was very funny, but it could have been a lot more convincing. I think what would have been more effective (but arguably less funny), is more focus on the fact that Maddox has been keeping things from his fans, explaining the specifics of how Maddox has hurt people, including sources, and a light suggestion to ask Maddox about it if the listener has any doubt or confusion.   I imagine one of the worst things about Maddox's position is being asked by genuine fans on Facebook, Twitter, "Is it true Sean is not coming back?", "Is it true you sued Dick & Asterios for 20 million dollars and he lost his job over it?", "Is it true you broke up TBPITU over an ex?", "Is it true you pretended to be a woman to get Asterios fired?", etc, etc, and then, instead of engaging with his fans, having to block them and deleting their questions to keep up appearances."
e4iqzr5;seabiscuity;1534806958.0;"Upload the bonus TBPITU episode he did with Madcucks as well as a new episode. That'd be hilarious. "
e4igr8g;lolilops;1534796039.0;"great idea"
e4ipu1c;branawesome;1534805915.0;"I can't find the feed anymore, was it taken down?"
e4jmlae;garretttf2;1534834250.0;"Is it that Dick just can't stop winning or Maddox just can't stop losing?"
e4ig6cq;bentanchorbolt;1534795208.0;"Why should he do any of that?  You fans that act like little girls that need this shitty drama are why Dick keeps the podcast stagnant.  He wants to give the fans what they want, and you grown men channeling little girls want the goss.  Grow up so this podcast can move on.It's almost like The Dick Show fans are all estrogen filled men that need their goss and bon bons.  "
e4iebmr;tommy_twofeet;1534792307.0;"All the episodes should be replaced with the Uncucked episodes and Dick should add (FIXED AUDIO) to the beginning of each title. Please for the love of God do this. 1. We got a tainted version of the show to begin with2. Uncucked versions would entice old listeners to relisten and get some new content3. Fuck Maddox"
e4iecg6;Ben2749;1534792347.0;"Yes, this too. With each starting with a disclaimer explaining what they are."
e4iefvm;Dark____Void;1534792509.0;"This. This all day long."
e4ikvcr;Easterdave420;1534801003.0;"This but on Spotify "
e4j30q8;crazytom57;1534817265.0;"See U Next Thursday!"
e4j7xm1;SpartanPhi;1534821425.0;"YES PLEASE"
e4jelua;MyNameIsRobPaulson;1534827013.0;"Wow. This would truly be an awesome end to this saga. The issue however is Maddox did a decent job structuring and producing the show (at least the end result) I also enjoyed the stupid cheesy soundboard. If it didn't have that format it wouldn't really feel like the show. Dunno if Dick would be interested in that sort of thing again. "
e4ifj1g;hoodwink77;1534794250.0;"Thing is, there isn't much engagement with his fans on his Facebook pages. He can't have many left to block."
e4ilxz1;NumberEightySeven;1534802166.0;"Dick was fucking Maddox without a condom and it felt too good, so he shot his load too early. He should have let Maddox keep the feed. That way he could throw in an intro here and there every once in awhile. It would have kept Maddox on edge, not know if Dick would reveal another scandal about him."
e4ig82y;Xoddamkcuc;1534795277.0;"Not a rage."
e4imhbz;tommy_twofeet;1534802717.0;"It's weird how a stagnant podcast has millions of downloads and sold out live shows. "
e4itgxi;KnapAttack;1534809126.0;"Stop downplaying this as 'shitty drama' as if we're still just talking about the rape list video or waterboi leaks.Do you understand that there are still active court cases going on as a result of this shit? Its still relevant, and its still hilarious. "
e4ip06o;Jack-Browser;1534805156.0;"Joke's on you, I work in the food service industry. All we do all day is shooting the hot goss."
e4ilssr;capnhancocker;1534802014.0;"This sounds like a grumble, where is grumblebee to confirm?"
e4izbqj;wauterboi;1534814171.0;"But I do need my goss and bon bons"
e4j16d2;apeshitdonkeydiq;1534815733.0;"I could go for some nice bon bons right now."
e4ih72e;SneakyMcGeee;1534796640.0;"Seriously. The show is awful now. Cannot believe it has turned into a shitty lolcow of the week show like the million other YouTubers. Dick calls himself a comedian. Do comedy already. "
e4ilmwo;derek_gagnon;1534801837.0;"I really hope tomorrow's episode is called Dick on Fixed Audio"
e4igawm;kaizervonmaanen;1534795390.0;"Great idea!"
e4ilqjy;NumberEightySeven;1534801946.0;"And Antoids should record a new intro for each uncucked episode, giving his commentary on what Maddox did to the episode."
e4jj9da;Xuju;1534831127.0;"Something tells me Tim Changzzzzzz would be happy to offer up his soundboard prowess, but I think it’s best to move on. I like The Dick Show. Biggest Problem was better, but Maddox was 50% of the show. As much as I hate Maddox now, it’s undeniable that the show worked so well because of the rivalry between Dick and Maddox. "
e4ilqr7;capnhancocker;1534801953.0;"His personal page actually has quite a bit of activity on it, so I wonder if he uses that more than his fan page for interacting because it feels safer for some reason?"
e4ink3f;bentanchorbolt;1534803795.0;"I'm not saying it isn't successful or that it sucks.  I like Dick and I like the show.  But it would be super cool if we moved passed the Maddox drama.  The show and Dick are better than that POS."
e4jlhg3;bentanchorbolt;1534833211.0;"It's only relevant because scores of Dick Show fans aren't interested in new content.   Maddox lost, will continue to lose, etc.  Let's move on."
e4jlj4g;bentanchorbolt;1534833255.0;"Bon bons ARE delicious.  "
e4ime0o;tommy_twofeet;1534802624.0;"Get a sense of humor.First off I don't think Dick has ever referred to himself as a comedian. He's a troll and always has been since the Dr. Phil days. Second, how is this any different than anything Dick has ever done? The only reason why you've heard of him is because he's a troll.What do you expect? Dick to just start doing a stand up routine during the show? Are you not aware of the other hour of content he brings to each episode that are also equally hilarious as fucking with Maddox? He brings in rages, Sean brings zingers, sometimes we get an entertaining guest, and to top it all off there is the goss. You are just nitpicking a single thing and projecting it as if the Goss is literally all there is to the show. It isn't. If you listened with your ears and not your asshole then you'd know that.Get rapes"
e4in883;Xoddamkcuc;1534803469.0;"You are free to have that opinion. I disagree and believe you are a cuckold."
e4iqzrt;Ctfc99;1534806959.0;"Listen to something else then."
e4jlq0m;MyNameIsRobPaulson;1534833438.0;"I could see Dick doing it for the BPITU fandom (and of course to completely absorb Maddox's legacy). But, probably not. Why work to make a structured show when TDS takes little to no prep and rakes in absurd amounts of cash and maintains a stable fanbase? I'd be curious to see a BPITU with Dick at the helm. Honestly a Dick and Asterios BPITU would be really fun. I think they are both genuinely opinionated and disagree but could keep it on a friendly level "
e4kbkwz;TheFlyingBastard;1534877355.0;"Dick really just needs a good foil."
e4izkdy;wauterboi;1534814373.0;"You are correct: the show and cast are indeed better than Maddox's show and Maddox. However, Maddox still interacts with Dick & Co in really dumb ways and I don't see what's wrong with Dick talking about it."
e4js0by;KnapAttack;1534847094.0;"If you don't think the downward spiral of one of the internet's first trolls in real time isn't fascinating, then you're in the wrong place. E: I'm accusing people of saying shit that other people said, maybe I am a fucking idiot"
e4j2qn2;SneakyMcGeee;1534817032.0;"Lol who are the multiple comedians you refer to when you all spaz out about the lawsuit. “Maddox has sued multiple comedians1!!!1!1!”Dick says it too.I expect the show to be good again like it was at the beginning before it became the trump, lolcow, and 4chan super show. Fag."
e4j428d;SneakyMcGeee;1534818129.0;"In what way since the lawsuit that he pretty much handed to an incompetent lawyer and fucked off to Mexico? I don’t care that asterios lost his job because I think asterios is a lying hypocrite that got himself fired. So what is maddox doing or has done since he lost the lawsuit? Dick losing money? Fuck off. Dick is rich. He’s probably going to make more money off the lawsuit in the long run."
e4js6ro;bentanchorbolt;1534847287.0;"I didn't say anything about Asterios.  You're confusing me with another user.  I also said nothing about the impact of the lolsuit on anyone.  Again, you're thinking of another user.And it's not that I don't find the downward spiral of Maddox fascinating or relevant, because I do.  I just don't like how that goss has become the main point of both The Dick Show and the fanbase.  Dick and Sean are fucking hilarious and have great chemistry.  Would like to see the show move away from Maddox.  It's going on two years now and I'm tired of it."
e4j75vr;Asshole2Assholes;1534820765.0;">multiple comedians 1. Dick 2. Madcucks 3.Asterios"
e4lhy1a;Asshole2Assholes;1534917442.0;"I answered your question. No response?"
e4j8y86;AlexWyvern;1534822282.0;"Hey look it's the guy who only ever shows up to white knight Maddox.Maddox has done plenty of nasty shit recently and you know it.But what's wrong with you? You sound more bitter and like you're choking back tears than you normally do. Not your peaceful, neutral self at all.Must be all that losing."
e4ju0aq;KnapAttack;1534849135.0;"You say Asterios is a lying hypocrite who got himself fired, without really saying why you think that. I'm sure it had nothing to do with Maddox emailing his boss trying to associate Asterios with a line Dick wrote in a satirical book ten years ago.You also think it's no big deal because "Dick is rich", I didn't realize you were his accountant. Oh, you're not? Then shut the fuck up. "Boohoo the lawsuit only cost him like 2 months of his Patreon", awesome then go ahead and send me 2 months of your salary, since apparently that has no effect on anyone's life. You have no idea what his financial situation is like, and the implication that it's not a big deal that Maddox cost Dick tens of thousands of dollars for no reason because Dick might be able to afford it is retarded."
e4japua;wauterboi;1534823779.0;"Well it's because I'm stupid, obviously! Now give me bon bons!"
e4kbr2d;TheFlyingBastard;1534877660.0;"I can see where you're coming from. Maddox is a joke. A dying joke. Funny shit is happening, like Dick putting that monologue on one of his episodes, but when a funny thing gets stretched out for too long, it loses its appeal.It's like the show doesn't really have a focus in and of itself, so it's going to turn outwards to Maddox, MundaneMatt, etc. It would be nice if that kind of goss was just a footnote and let the show have its own structure. The lolsuit drove people to make a lot of great home made content, including tracks on the Dick Show Album. It's something you can enjoy on its own merit without having a dash of "Maddox, lol" ruining the flavour. Come and think of it, it's funner if Dick is winning than if Maddox is losing."
e4m6e13;SneakyMcGeee;1534942415.0;"Right. I said dick is a comedian, so be funny. That guy said dick is never referred to as a comedian, so I asked who are the comedians he is referring to then?"
e4lzsov;SneakyMcGeee;1534935008.0;"Sorry. Where at? edit found it. You were confused."
e4m05tq;SneakyMcGeee;1534935382.0;"I think that because all the bullshit he has claimed like maddox crying, despite two people in the room having no idea what he is talking about. How he cried about gamer gate and lost his shit enough at a bar when tim pool asked him if someone on the show said faggot, but then begs kiwi farms for money. He cried about being "doxxed" when no one ever doxxed him. He was just exposed for wanting to play both sides to keep the scrilla flowing. I think he's unfunny, loud, and annoying. He is the dickshow clown. He literally has to dress as santa and pull his pants down to get laughs.  And I think he's an asshole.  Regardless, if I used company equipment to troll someone at my job, I'd get fired. Fuck him.  I don't care what Dick's financial situation is because I know he's rich. Eat me.  "
e4md0wf;Asshole2Assholes;1534953700.0;"Well, Dick did do UCB before Maddox. Whether or not he calls himself a comedian, he's a comedian.But for sake of argument. ~~1.DICK 2.~~ 1. Madcucks 2. Asterios"
e4n2gfy;KnapAttack;1534985020.0;"If you think asterios is an unfunny asshole, fine, hes pretty polarizing. But I think someone frivolously suing your place of work so that it becomes public knowledge who your employer is constitutes as doxxing. Speaking of which, theres no evidence that he used his work computer for bantz beyond some chopped up out of context quote in the lolsuit that was dismissed, so I find it weird that youre just taking maddoxs word for it after he committed perjury and was *actually* a lying hypocrite, not just some loudmouth who said someone cried when they might not have.And you obviously do care about dicks finances, because your stance is based off of what you think his situation is ('who cares, hes rich'), which, again, you have no way of knowing. Even if he is rich, who cares? He's not '50k aint shit' rich, and either way its none of your fucking business.  You sound like Maddox on one of his 'fuck rich people' rant. Mind your own."
e4mdalx;SneakyMcGeee;1534954274.0;"I mean that is what I was saying, I am agreeing with you."
e4o15oe;SneakyMcGeee;1535014855.0;"Then he shouldn't have used company property to troll. Fuck 'em. You guys get so hypocritical when you white knight your heroes."
e4mdgon;Asshole2Assholes;1534954634.0;"Whoops. Well I'll just blame it on the fact that it's late/early and I'm a bit high, so I misunderstood. lol "
e4o4dqe;KnapAttack;1535018025.0;"Got it, so you think anyone who is even *accused* of fucking around during work deserves to get fired and slapped with tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. No wonder you don't fit in around here."

99d0fb;FiveSmash;1534970677.0;Can someone explain the details of the feed hijack?
99d0fb;FiveSmash;1534970677.0;"I don’t know how podcast feeds work so I still have questions.Has Maddox been signing into Dick’s Apple account for the last 2 years to add episodes / update metadata, or is that all stored wherever it’s hosted?I assume Dick only had access to the Apple account, so he couldn’t add the edited episode to wherever Maddox hosts TBD, right? Does that mean he hosted it elsewhere, and redirected the episode 113 link in iTunes to his copy? "

e4mnazp;Tamrowski;1534971490.0;"No. Basically this (making some general assumptions). You have to go through a few steps to get listed on iTunes. Have your files hosted somewhere, in many cases they build the RSS feed for you. You then sign up with iTunes and input the information, meaning the RSS feed was then put in and linked, album art, etc That feed pointed to the biggest problem in the universe. Dick did this on the iTunes end. (Not sure who set up the libsyn stuff)When the show ended instead of setting up a new feed, with a new listing in iTunes, Maddox simply changed all the information on the biggest problem account and repurposed it to fit his new terrible show. He did not make a new account and set up iTunes information showing ownership.So iTunes just pulled from the old feed, giving Maddox every listener in mourning when the old show ended. But being an idiot he forgot that Dick originally set up the iTunes information, giving him actual control on the account. So Dick was able to change where the feed got its information from, pointing it to a better site where he could control what version of the audio went up. Maddox in his attempt to get free listeners and use old metrics fucked himself but Dick was generous not to fuck him over until he called him a fake Mexican who hates Mexicans and beats women. Which in turn Dick simply deleted accounts linked to his email. Feed deleted.(If I missed anything or skimmed over anything feel free to fill in the gaps)"
e4n7p74;rbcp;1534989243.0;"I'm bummed that Dick completely deleted the feed. He could have had at least a couple more weeks of fun with that, letting more Maddox listeners understand what's been happening. Or he could have permanently redirected it to the feed for the Uncucked episodes, maybe with short bumpers on the beginning of each one explaining the goss and telling people about his new show. If there was an actual reason for him deleting it other than punishing Maddox for spreading rumors, I missed it."
e4mo0lc;SnakeJerusalem;1534972273.0;"> Maddox in his attempt to get free listeners and use old metrics fucked himself but Dick was generous not to fuck him over until he called him a fake Mexican who hates Mexicans and beats women.The fake Mexican and wife beating allegations only poped up after Dick fiddled with the feed (which initially came from recently red-pilled TBDIU listeners). Dick found out he still had access to itunes in January and waited 8 mounths to pull this off, probably because he needed to have both the trademark dispute and the lolsuit settled and resolved before pulling the trigger on this."
e4mpcdx;FiveSmash;1534973637.0;"> instead of setting up a new feed, with a new listing in iTunes, Maddox simply changed all the information on the biggest problem accountIs that a shared entity that Dick's and Maddox's Apple accounts both had access to, despite Dick's account being the actual owner? Or was he still using Dick's account? That would be extra dumb.How did Dick not realize that he still had ownership of the feed, if it was created and owned by his account? Why didn't he just shut it down when Maddox originally stole it?> So Dick was able to change where the feed got its information fromSo Dick *did* redirect just episode 113 to his version? It doesn't make sense that he would re-host the whole dumpster fire of TBD just to add the bumper to 113.> Dick was generous not to fuck him over until he called him a fake Mexican who hates Mexicans and beats women.Hadn't Dick already completely taken over the TBD feed and locked out Maddox, since Maddox was unable to remove the 113 redirect? That's effectively deleting the feed because Maddox couldn't go on using it."
e4nbxej;oedipism_for_one;1534992696.0;"He explanes why he did not want to do that in the most recent episode and it’s a fair point no fans belong to him or Maddox.As for your other points Maddox took over another feed that he controls and thus dick cans fuck with it anymore. But all and all it was pretty funny and we got new dick converts."
e4mornb;Tamrowski;1534973059.0;"Ahhhh. I thought these were older leaks that a fan just gave to Dick upon learning that Dick was the good guy in all of this!"
e4mw2vt;Tamrowski;1534979849.0;"* The iTunes submission was done under Dick's personal email address that was not shared with Maddox. So it was Dick's account. Just like Maddox owns the domain for thebiggestproblemintheuniverse, Dick just forgot he had set it up and with which email, to be fair it was years ago and there's really no reason to login and check on it when things are running smoothly. Maddox wouldn't have to login to change things, it's pretty point and click when reusing a feed. Plus, Dick set up The Dick Show feed using a different iTunes account.* I believe the feed was changed to point at sadcastmedia, he didn't nuke the feed initially because he didn't feel it was right to punish fans who actually do listen to and enjoy Maddox's show. This is America they're allow to like trash if their tastes are trashy. But I'm not sure if he had to re-upload every episode or how that worked, honestly.* Dick didn't delete the feed at first. He left it there until leaks came out showing Maddox talking even more shit. Thus Dick revoking his feed privileges. How was Maddox going to be upload to Dick's feed going forward? Who knows. We won't ever get the chance to find out, but we all know Dick is a reasonable, honorable, man who could have worked it out the kinks."
e4opo2t;OhSoSavvy;1535050621.0;"After Dick deleted the feed and Maddox set up a new one, does that mean Maddox lost all the subs and have to start from scratch?That’d be hilarious. No way he gets anywhere close to where he was before based purely on the merits of this new show"
e4nqc9f;Ashanmaril;1535004733.0;"I think you misread. He's saying he wish Dick DIDN'T delete the feed. You're right Dick said he didn't want to do that, but then he did it."
e4moy7z;SnakeJerusalem;1534973243.0;"The screenshot that Dick shared absolutely is an older leak. But it was sent to Dick after he tweeted about Maddox spreading that bullshit."
e4n3kod;Anudem;1534985913.0;"Is there a transcript of these leaks?"
e4ournp;oedipism_for_one;1535057627.0;"Kinda I think there was another feed he snagged. He should have started fresh that would have been the smart thing. He probably messaged apple podcast guy to try and “save” all his subs"
e4mr175;Tamrowski;1534975294.0;"Okay I thought that was the case. I'm sure current shit talk is even more insane"

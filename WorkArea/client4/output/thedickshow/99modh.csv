99modh;Lpup;1535053526.0;maybe Maddox should consider just going full SJW and being a paid speaker for elementary schools about the dangers of cyberbullying
99modh;Lpup;1535053526.0;"I was talking to the nephew and niece of my ex, and they were telling me cyberbullying seminars are all the new hotness in middle school and highschool.Later in the week I saw a guy for DARE trying to get funding to bring it back to schools, telling me they've changed the focus of the program to be aimed at cyber bullying equally as much as drug use.Schools are really pushing this online safe space crap. Since Maddox has 0 dignity, principals, morals, standards and is desperate for money he should just disavow his entire life and make a living about the dangers of those dang dirty trolls. I know you're probably thinking "The guy employees people who have restraining orders from pulling that shut, has an entire career dedicated to being this, and would be a giant hypocrite pussy if he did this." Yes, all of that is correct but its the public school system so when has any of that stopped a speaker from getting paid to speak. Think of the positives:* Maddox finally has a new audience* Maddox finally gets paid* Maddox can pretend every fuck up he ever did never happened* Maddox will finally be surrounded by intellectual equals"

e4os5yt;JMC266;1535054423.0;"With as many pedophiles as Maddox associates with,  and his previous history of calling elementary schools he probably shouldn't be allowed anywhere near one."
e4owacp;backwards7ven;1535059257.0;"Daytime talk shows would love the story of a former 'internet troll' who put his past behind him and now advises education authorities on internet safety. Not only would it allow George to put his misdeeds behind him, but he would actually be captitalising off the story of his decline and his subsequent recovery. This is his road back to financial solvency and even moderate wealth and influence. It would come at the cost of his pride and integrity but neither is worth more than a few dollars anyway."
e4ox7hn;UghImAWriter;1535060173.0;"i once had a school speaker come talk about how she was drunk driving and then killed a guy but then that guy's family forgave her because she was a cute young college girl. Maybe Maddox could do that as Heather S"

He cucked me every time, and now here I am, a loser talking to children about crap he doesn't believe in. Remember, kids: cyberbulling - not even once."
e4owndv;m1serablist;1535059620.0;"To do that, that waste of resources would have to at least dress in a smart casual way and get a decent haircut and shave, I don't think he can do it. The restrictive clothes would overload his autistic senses "
e4ownsh;lolilops;1535059632.0;"There is no way any rational person would let that bald creepy cringe of human trash anywhere close to their children.

The way they pitched it and how she said it was, once they got into a court room, the family came to her, prayed about it, told her they forgive her, etc - because she has so much life left in her. She says it was really humbling or some shit, and that she just had to do community service by going to schools to talk about it (no record, no other issues, etc).  However, she *was* a cute little college girl and cheerleader, so that was probably a deciding factor"

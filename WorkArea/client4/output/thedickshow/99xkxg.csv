e4r6so4;Ashanmaril;1535150322.0;"I was on the Madcast site the other day during the voting and out of curiosity clicked into this guy's show. I'm fairly confident this is just a fluff show Maddox added to the network out of desperation so it wasn't just 2 shows like it was for so long. He has a patreon that's been up for seemingly about a year with nobody on it. Apparently he's a comedian but I watched his whole Patreon pitch and he didn't make a single joke in it. He's so uninteresting nobody has anything to say about him.edit: also he charges $100 on his Patreon to be on an episode of his show when really he should be paying people to be on it. I wonder if the great Dick Masterson could get on an episode of his show, might improve it!"

e4r7mjq;DoctorMadcow;1535151045.0;"That's an interesting idea. If Dick paid the $100 to be on a Madcast show, does he have to comply? "
e4ramyz;RazorCandies;1535153610.0;"Holy hell. I thought you were joking but here it is https://www.patreon.com/zachwaldman $0 a month. On October 7 he made a post to absolutely no one about upgrading his podcast. What the hell keeps him going? "

I wonder if the great Dick Masterson could get on an episode of his show, might improve it!It would not be as classic of a trolling than what Dick did with the feed, but it would still be a pretty neat follow up!"

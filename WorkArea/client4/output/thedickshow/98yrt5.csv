e4ju2hg;Builtro;1534849197.0;"Just imagine if an attractive guy did this to a bunch of women. The guy would have lost his job within the day. "
e4jpr8n;rockfordphile;1534841716.0;"Vote up unfair internet bans. Or vote it down because the dating advice girl was an idiot."
e4jsn7u;kaizervonmaanen;1534847759.0;"Who would accept a underhanded lie like that on the first date? It's not that difficult to get dates. "
e4jpmeo;scott_zoloft;1534841357.0;"yea that explains it"
e4k71qn;Dinnadoxmebra;1534868007.0;"I can't help but juxtapose this against articles by 30-something women complaining that there are no good men out there and blaming tinder and "dating culture".If both are examples of the toxicity and entitlement out there, I'm glad I'm off the market."
e4kb0g2;Bankrupt84;1534876295.0;"Thats fucked up. Some people are really on Tinder to USE The app and others are a bunch of attention whores who give zero shits. I hope she gets zero dates from here going forward and that she finds it difficult to date."

e4jplhu;victor_edge;1534841292.0;"I don't really post much but this explains every bad date from an online dating site I've ever had."
e4k3ibp;poorlytaxidermiedfox;1534861188.0;"Unless they did it ironically, just to have a chance to say "no thanks" if they won."
e4jzd2i;victor_edge;1534855101.0;"He'd be called Dick"
e4k38w8;CivicPlaza;1534860755.0;"Her and her multiple boyfriends... Most annoying guest by far which is impressive given how often Asterios was on."
e4jvz0u;victor_edge;1534851144.0;"The thing is that I've had a chick try to do something like this to me. On OkCupid we talked for a bit, got each other's numbers then just stopped talking for a few weeks. All the sudden I get a text from her saying something like, "I'm sick the first guy to bring me some soup, I will date", I told her to fuck off. She was from the SF area and I swear to this day, SF and white Oakland girls are just the worst kind of people."
e4jv5kk;No_Thot_Control;1534850286.0;"Not that difficult no, but the quality of the women is another question."
e4n9cnk;Arcticfox04;1534990590.0;"Long as there's Cucks in this world she'll find dates easily."
e4kgklf;johnnysteen;1534885045.0;"Asterios was great when she was on. "WHY DON'T YOU TEXT ONE OF YOUR NINE BOYFRIENDS?" "...It's ten, now...""
e4k512j;AlexWyvern;1534863905.0;"I tried OkCupid a few years back now and like 90% of chicks on there were claiming to be bi or some shit for attention."

e4lgkzd;CivicPlaza;1534916249.0;"And Dick railed her with his lecture on love and courtship,  [“the most misogynistic person on the internet is now explaining to peopld the basics of love and courtship”](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lNZ-Njp1YCw)"
e4katlb;Bankrupt84;1534875933.0;"The “In” thing is to claim to be Bi."
e4obzyk;mshm;1535026501.0;"This and his netflix rant are the top 2 Dick rants of all time for me. His ability to just go off for ages without stopping, keeping a consistent thread, based on anything at all is absolutely incredible."
e4kd1v5;AlexWyvern;1534879827.0;"They were also weird as fuck, and not in a good way.. I met a chick on OkCupid who played for the national Quidditch team (I'm not shitting you, like IRL Harry Potter Quidditch - I looked up a video on YouTube and it was[ the most pathetic thing I've ever seen](https://youtu.be/OmkWyPjbR74?t=3m8s)).  She wasn't a 10 or anything, but she was kind of attractive in an unorthodox way. Plus she had good tits so I thought... sunk-cost fallacy and took her home anyway. When I got her naked I discovered she was one of these no-shaving feminist types. I was nearly sick and she accused me of "not valuing strong women" or some shit.Another OKC chick turned up in an evening gown to the local pub. She was loopy."
e4ke2qc;Ever-Frost;1534881316.0;"It's like field hockey with marginally fewer lesbians."
e4qa3qs;Bankrupt84;1535103982.0;"Unless you are a real wizard, and can actually fly Quidditch ain't real. And that ain't happening anytime soon. I've heard about those wannabe Quidditch teams. Its just weird. Any why do feminists feel that their body image is what makes them a feminist and pro-female rights. Its the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Being a strong woman has nothing to do with hairy armpits and crotches. Gross. "

e4kjbgt;PantherHeel93;1534887990.0;"What?"
e4kne3b;Demplition;1534891783.0;"Did he say why 8 months or why he released when he did?"
e4kq6il;PaulaAbduhlJabbar;1534894176.0;"Some people would argue 8 months is premature but I thought it was perfect."

e4kjz04;m1serablist;1534888625.0;"dick was aware of the fact that he can access and change cuckdox's podcast feed, he found out about it 8 months ago while gathering evidence for the trademark lawsuit."
e4kqr6q;Kevl17;1534894652.0;"That's what I want to know. What made him choose that particular episode to do it."
e4l6dc7;Antoids;1534907635.0;"I'm guessing he wanted the legal weight of owning 50% of the trademark behind his actions, and to avoid it being used in the main lolsuit."
e4ke3pq;corrective_rape_fan;1534881355.0;"Did this need to be a comment?"
e4kihtm;BobJWHenderson;1534887165.0;"I guess being fat has clogged your tiny brain and made you forget what it’s like to be excited about something that isn’t a donut. "
e4kzqiu;BurnCourt;1534902102.0;"Burner provided no evidence of how "that turned out".  Burn dismissed."
e4ksivn;Subsonic-Sparkle;1534896100.0;"Granted. Court adjourned. We’re done."
e4l38su;BloodFartTheQueefer;1534905034.0;"Maybe the idea came to him randomly and then within a couple of weeks he decided to act on it. He's right that simply nuking the podcast feed wouldn't be THAT entertaining and maybe wanted to wait until he came up with something (and the lolsuit was over). Perhaps maddox being slow to upload and stuff recently made now seem like a good time to strike since he has lots of issues on his mind (how to respond to lolsuit, sanctions, etc. without his lawyer)"
e4lzssn;tefloncondom;1534935011.0;"My guess is a retaliation for the latest legal threat that Dick won't talk about. I don't think it was all that random."
e4kino8;RalphMolemanMelish;1534887334.0;"No"

e4l079p;kaizervonmaanen;1534902497.0;"Haha... Fitting name"
e4l5oym;poorlytaxidermiedfox;1534907063.0;"More than likely, he wanted to wait until *all* lawsuit shenanigans were behind him, to avoid further legal bills with amended complaints and whatnot."
e4km018;pi_over_3;1534890551.0;"Ok."

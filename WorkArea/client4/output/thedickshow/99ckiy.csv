99ckiy;backwards7ven;1534966590.0;"**The Mac Poch** –  Commercialised version of Armenian cow-tail soup, cooked by American pig dogs for Idaho branches of MacDonald's, is (to horror of my mother and her mother who must cross herself and murmur hasty prayers) made with superior tails of buffalo, cleansed using modern industrial processes instead of quick rinse under village tap or in river.    **Armenia Land, Euro Disney** - Where is Disney middle manager dressed as social realist film director, Sergei Parajanov? Where is informative mural describing for children formation of First Republic of Armenia? Instead there is only roller-coaster with track imitating slow but steady rise in Armenian GDP. The Mount Ararat Experience – symbol of Armenia Land - lies across park border in neighbouring Turkey Land.    **Leo Tuomi who faked his Armenian nationality for 37 years for obscure religious reasons -** Even though he says he is from Armenia his passport is from Finland.    **Simulacrum of a Down –** Do not be fooled by inferior tribute copy of Armenian/American rock and roll band, System of a Down. Lead singer's name is Mike and in other job he is coffee slave at Starbucks!    Also, one time Maddox arranged for delivery of goat for one hour rental. For what purpose he wants this goat I do not know. Perhaps for milking, or maybe he wants goat to milk him, eh?  When clock radio say that it is 3 in the afternoon, Maddox gets up from his bed to eat sour plum soup and to shout at old woman he lives with, who is either his mother or his wife. Goat had still not arrived. Maddox begins furious tirade concerning unreliability of Armenian goatherds. He places a curse upon absent goatherd and his family lasting next seven generations. It its true! Both Davit and Vahan were there when it happened. Two weeks later goatherd and entire family is killed by T-72 Soviet Tank driven by Armenian separatists who want to join with Georgia. These guys are crazy."

Spiritually they were following in the footsteps of Sepultura merging elements of indigenous music with popularist hard metal. I was going through a heavy country music phase when Toxicity came out, so they passed me by."

e4ih05g;kaizervonmaanen;1534796381.0;"I wonder why Maddox get so many pedos as fans. His show is not pedo or child themed. Maybe they just recognise someone who is rejected by society due to his degenerate behaviour and sees themselves in him."

e4ifs81;Qayden;1534794638.0;"No offense, but you must have lived a pretty sheltered life if you think mental illness is the only cause of this behavior. The world is full of people like Maddox and they're just called assholes."
e4ihpwu;Qayden;1534797316.0;"Yeah, and he even did a pedo-reach-out by bringing in a problem on the old podcast that was something like "there's nothing inherently wrong with being a pedo"."
e4idgtc;Ben2749;1534790723.0;"Given that he originally stole all the positive ratings from BPitU for TBD with the old feed, it's poetic justice that when he tried to do it a second time with another BPitU feed he had, he ended up stealing a bunch of bad ratings."

Maddox replaced his stupid ‚ÄúBiggest Problem in the Universe (Official)‚Äù feed on iTunes with a feed for ‚ÄúBest Debate‚Äù. Check out the reviews!Unbelievably...that makes it TWICE now Maddox has stolen an RSS feed out from under fans of The Biggest Problem in the Universe in order to inflate the download numbers for his bedroom-based shill-fest.‚ÄùMy take from that is that Maddox owned a secondary BPitU feed aside from the one he hijacked two years ago. And now he‚Äôs done the same with that one."
e4gy70b;688as;1534727567.0;"Probably not. "
e4h0uxf;FiveSmash;1534730122.0;"Yeah after Dick put up the TBPITU archived page and podcast feed, Maddox made a petty "Biggest Problem in the Universe **(Official)**" feed. Which he fucked up and the episodes were out of order. And now he's turned that feed into TBD. Sad!"

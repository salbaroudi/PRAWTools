e4kgta2;WheresTheButterAt;1534885325.0;"Imagine being the guy who used to post and make fun of his hatemail and turning into this."
e4kgwep;BenadrylPeppers;1534885426.0;"Does he completely forget his hate mail section where for YEARS he posted peoples personal information and told his fans to harass them?The same section that is still up?"
e4kgo5y;Mr-Scurvy;1534885162.0;"Yep Maddox, you definitely didn't do a single thing to incite people over these past two years. Just been sitting there innocently minding your own business..."
e4kkkxn;hoodwink77;1534889219.0;"‚úã"
e4khoyp;DoYouKnowofMe;1534886318.0;"He always adds the word ‚Äúencourage‚Äù to shit like this. NO ONES BEING ENCOURAGED TO DISLIKE YOU. Sorry, Maddox. You‚Äôre just highly unlikeable and it‚Äôs all directly because of your own actions. There‚Äôs no organized campaign against you."
e4ki475;MarcMoron;1534886762.0;"High-five, my buddy."
e4kjh07;Bojangles_Unchained;1534888142.0;"Well, gee, I was a Maddox fan and bought his books and stuff until I started frequenting all these creepy hate forums, which encouraged me via internet points to start thinking that Maddox is actually a really shitty person. I now see the error of my ways. High-fives: not even once."
e4kh8xa;MomentOfXen;1534885826.0;">forumsHey, Facebook is just a creepy deviant forum, this is the only hate forum you cock."
e4kkotw;Skrongman;1534889325.0;"Shout out to all of you guys, I hope you feel even more encouraged!"
e4kjzlt;BrassHockey;1534888642.0;"He sued a bunch of people and tried to get them fired!  It doesn't get more obsessed/hateful than that.     And his misinformation campaign and attempts to pretend the people who see through his BS don't exist only make them stronger.  "
e4ksu1u;chronus_poo;1534896366.0;"It's true. Dick and Asterios were associated with Maddox and they were harassed constantly for the last two years."
e4kgo8m;DoYouKnowofMe;1534885164.0;"This is great, but what did he say above that? "
e4ks4dc;Spork_Of_Doom;1534895766.0;"He literally sued everyone and their boss.How does he get to say shit like this without his fans just screaming at him?"
e4kuinu;Ctfc99;1534897779.0;"Shout out to JMC266, I hope you enjoy the internet point I gave you"
e4l3xzu;SpicyTonyPA;1534905614.0;"Shout out to OP for his fake internet points!"
e4lasmt;buffer_overfl0w;1534911386.0;"Maddox is a hypocrite. He's done aweful things to people. The reason why he won't mention it on his podcast or even acknowledge that he's sued people is because he wants people to see that he is the victim and everyone is out to get him. That's what Maddox is and the same goes for a lot of these YouTube personalities. They can't see anything wrong in their actions, they believe they are the victims. It's like Mundane Matt, typical example of a little narcissist. He's always like "me... me... me... I'm going to be a dad and I'm scared". What about his wife? Does she not matter or his wife's kid? Hypocrisy runs deep in the kingdom of soy. "

e4m0vk1;biobb36;1534936103.0;">obsessedOpie was going on about how Jim Norton and Anthony Cumia are obsessed with him and can't stop talking about him. I think it was Jim who said something like "we're not obsessed with you Opie, you're just a lot of fun to make fun of""
e4kk9qv;DoodSalamander;1534888914.0;"Not sure how anyone can continue to be fans of someone who believes they‚Äôve made decisions on who to like based on some fucked Pavlovian model. Fuck you maddox. I don‚Äôt need treats from Dick to know he‚Äôs better than you at everything."

e4lp9rn;SnakeJerusalem;1534924489.0;"Maddox, you dumb motherfucker. Lets assume, *arguendo*, you are correct about is (which you are not). Then why the flying fuck would you keep talking and spreading bullshit to anyone willing to talk to you? Don't you see that by doing that you only keep feeding our hate-forum?  How stupid do you have to be?"
e4o3f9s;Mastrrbasser;1535017070.0;"When I describe this whole podcast thing to friends I describe it like this:There was a podcast with 2 characters: Dick Masterson who was the loathsome alter-ego of Dax. And George, who was the loathsome alter-ego of Maddox.  "
e4ki9pn;BobJWHenderson;1534886927.0;"It‚Äôs not even the same person anymore. There‚Äôs late 90‚Äôs/internet 1.0 Maddox and there‚Äôs the 21st Century Cuck Maddox. "

e4l5emz;GADBabaganoosh;1534906824.0;"Remember when he [doxxed a kid on the I Am Better Than Your Kids website for his book?](http://www.iambetterthanyourkids.com/?u=top) He criticized the kid who told maddox he doesnt know comedy so maddox posted every detail of the kid, bunch of pics from presumably facebook. Sounds like a targetted harassment campaign.>On privacy: everything posted here is available publically on Tomek's own accounts that he has chosen to share. Some of my readers think this is carte blanche to start posting personal information such as his phone number, school, address, etc. It is not. Also, all use of his public images here are used for the purposes of commentary or criticism, and are fair use. Don't go posting his private information everywhere. He's a careless idiot, don't be one too.HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMGUYS HIS SHITS PUBLICLY AVAILABE BUT DON'T HARASS HIM!

e4kkv96;SithisTheDreadFather;1534889494.0;"Well, Maddox continuously being a litigious, slandering, despicable moron has encouraged me to dislike him quite a lot."
e4lc3vn;mawppp;1534912473.0;"I forget exactly where it is in BPITU but there's a point where he says he's rarely called out on his hypocritical views, I.E. at least 60% of the content on this reddit. Yeah Maddox, you're the only person responsible for your situation lol. "

99tflt;carlcarlsonfromthesi;1535104823.0;"I was told one was given out (#5)?  Is it lost forever?"

e4qbkkh;chissme;1535105444.0;"It was, asterios held a contest for it. But I'm not joking, a black man came along and asterios was so impressed with his blackness that he just threw the whole contest and gave it away to him for free, and because of that stint we're never going to see the episode ever."
e4qjmjo;kaizervonmaanen;1535114923.0;"We will never see it. "
e4qiu73;Linrraba;1535113847.0;"I hope Dick himself posts it. Otherwise could it be given to someone else in the next road rage?"
e4qgtjr;TheChickOfDestiny;1535111306.0;"Actually, he got scared because as a liberal he loves black people but he never saw them in the wild before. So he threw the episode across the room to distract him so he could escape."
e4qfsmd;johnnysteen;1535110093.0;"I mean, surely Dick still has a copy somewhere right? "
e4qbysg;asterioskokkinos;1535105885.0;"That's not at all true! He was a fan of mine. He brought a giant bag of weed specifically to smoke with me, and got a bunch of us high after the show.That's why he said his grumble was when you don't get nuggets fast enough -- he knew I'd be into it!"
e4qw6x2;Mr-Scurvy;1535138200.0;"I agree, should be given out at the next road rage and continue giving the same episode out until it makes its way online."
e4qcfq3;carlcarlsonfromthesi;1535106407.0;"It was only a matter of time before a nugget-loving, [patreon.com/asterios](https://patreon.com/asterios), non-reddit/facebook-uploading fan came along to get everyone high and hoard a lost episode."
e4qd96k;asterioskokkinos;1535107300.0;"Yeah i mean he might just not be on the reddit is what i assumed. It was very cool when he pulled out a big bag of weed and said, "I came here for one reason: to smoke with Asterios Kokkinos!"And like any true fan of mine, he didn't take the additional step to remember a bowl or papers or anything. He was just very excited about his big bag of weed."
e4tszyn;IvhL;1535258195.0;"Asterios, I drove him to the Cheetah and waited for you, Siracha, Peach, and Dick. You three got sick and Peach and Siracha came to the club. Where did he go?"
e4uo9wt;asterioskokkinos;1535294515.0;"I have no idea!! I wish i knew. He was very cool to all of us."

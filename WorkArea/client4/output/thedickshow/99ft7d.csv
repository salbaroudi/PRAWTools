e4ncs4k;vAxAv;1534993395.0;"I actually think this wierd dancing  and air guitaring shit is their way to shake off the haters. They are getting in the zone...the fun zone...forget a that real world bullshit!!...but they can't shake it off...only pretend...and the result is this awkward shit."
e4nb0gm;CivicPlaza;1534991945.0;"Its funny he has to read off his intro... I guess he doesnt know what the name of his show is either. "

e4nkj3a;AffirmativeNod;1534999758.0;"That episode 113 when he tried to read the intro to the music? It felt so unnatural. WELcome TO the BEST deBATE. IN the UniVERSE. Add the horrid volume difference and this dancing and you've got the tone set alright."
e4npq70;Tds_jecht;1535004186.0;"This is really sad. I mean it. If I saw a friend doing this I...I...dont know what I'd do. He genuinely doesn't seem to have any self awareness, and to make it worse, he made it past 40 without anyone to help him understand how delusional he is. He doesn't have friends; he has sycophantic sadists that parade as friends. No one should do the things he's done, especially not a grown as "man.""
e4nwbao;ChaosCowboy;1535010221.0;"I remember Maddox in some interview where the guy asked him what music he liked and all Maddox could pull out of his ass was "Metal", specifically Pantera and uhhhh well Pantera's great, and "chiptunes". The guy's been listening to the same music since 1994, and it's Pantera's hit single "Walk", and anything in the background of whatever gay-ass video game he's playing."

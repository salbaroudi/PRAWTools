98kpcn;Dolphin_McRibs;1534718665.0;"Where the hell is the lost episode that was given out at atlanta?"

e4h5nr9;johnnysteen;1534734836.0;"I'm not saying u/DickMasterson *should* make a fake throwaway reddit account pretending to be the guy who won with a link to mega.nz, but it would be perfectly understandable if he did."
e4gqbox;Linrraba;1534719784.0;"This one was indeed lost "
e4guytw;avnavar;1534724460.0;"Itsa me, Maddox! I infiltrated that Road Rage with the help of my world famous disguises and the spy kit I earned with mail-in Campbell's soup labels. Now I got the lost episode!I'll release it if you give me the following:*1 billion honest votes on my site. (I'll know if they're fake dickhead!)*A pinky swear from you all to stop calling me a cuck and a faggot*A new bike w/ some fresh cards to put in the spokes*One last date with 80s girl. We'll go somewhere real nice like Olive GardenIf these demands aren't met soon, I'll hide the episode in a copy of F*ck Whales in a Barnes & Noble, where it will remain for all eternity! Nyagh!"
e4h279z;SlashBolt;1534731424.0;"The boy who won it is named Emir. In the short time that I've gotten to know him at RR:A I understood him as a man of class and taste. I'm sure he won't let us down."
e4hkvka;SilentEric;1534750070.0;"I should have won that with my board game grumble. I wouldn't have let everyone down like this."
e4hoovs;Agent_Slade;1534753939.0;"Is there a collected list of the lost episode downloads?"
e4groqk;NumberEightySeven;1534721239.0;"Why accept the lost episode if you can't be arsed to upload it to soundcloud? It only takes a few mouse clicks to do it."
e4gv0fl;smohqe;1534724504.0;"i kinda like the way it's done.  it gives a weird sense of community.  so far, nobody has let us down.  here's hoping atlanta dude comes thru"
e4i6yd9;NextBiggieThing;1534776943.0;"they gave it to a black guy so he is probably still trying to listen to it without yelling over them"
e4gpw2w;vAxAv;1534719319.0;"Real talk, I don't like at all how that was handled. Why give so much power to one dickhead? Its entertainment, we all want to hear it, and now we may never. Dick, have you not learned from Wu Tang's mistakes? Publish the shit!"
e4hquxj;jagermitchell;1534756143.0;"During the show I never even saw the transaction take place, just saw Emir run off. Assumed Asterios never handed it to him so I asked for it. Looking back, he probably already had it."
e4icj43;kaizervonmaanen;1534788868.0;"We will never see that episode, it was won by a maddox fan"
e4gpsod;Grand_Admiral_C;1534719220.0;"I will gladly allow 3 more days for it to be posted, in exchange for a form date for the next road rage today."
e4gq8ui;TMacsLazyEye;1534719699.0;"All the generic Zoloft?"
e4gy1p9;iamlovemonkey;1534727427.0;"Oh shit! Olive Garden! He's not messing around! "
e4gxzrh;buffer_overfl0w;1534727376.0;"Oh fuck!"
e4icl4x;kaizervonmaanen;1534788984.0;"I agree to all except this:>*A pinky swear from you all to stop calling me a cuck and a faggotI can't just choose one to call you, Maddox. I need both."
e4h61wc;hugh_jessel;1534735228.0;"Maybe he's being held up by the TSA"
e4hrfev;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534756743.0;"By the looks of it, he's already let us down. This is the longest wait on record. I counted."
e4hn28g;Dolphin_McRibs;1534752286.0;"That was a great grumble."
e4icm3h;kaizervonmaanen;1534789040.0;"Should have made it nugget-themed board games."
e4hri2f;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534756821.0;"Not that I know of, but there should be."
e4hyht3;Lorddunksworth;1534764220.0;"I made sure to post mine on a tuesday,as is tradition."
e4h99eh;elvenmonk;1534738410.0;"The Dallas one was posted?"
e4gqu8q;aciou;1534720348.0;"it's worked out alright so far. though last time it was given to a facebook dickhead and they're all retarded so it took a few weeks for the upload."
e4gqf2r;Linrraba;1534719888.0;"Giving as a gift is not a bad idea but dick should published anyway. Waiting for the one who won to post it is what's wrong."
e4hyeq6;Lorddunksworth;1534764119.0;"They have a great steak for 13.99"
e4ha176;smohqe;1534739176.0;"i think [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDickShow/comments/8x1eo1/lost_episode_4/) was from dallas?"
e4hqy98;jagermitchell;1534756239.0;"It was posted to IRC and subsequently here a couple weeks after Dallas."
e4gsa1i;Dolphin_McRibs;1534721818.0;"Honestly, I kinda always knew at least 1 would disappear."
e4hr1z5;jagermitchell;1534756346.0;"He's a Facebook dickhead in my heart but in regards to the lost episode taking 2 weeks to get posted-- I'll let IRC have him."
e4gsdzg;Linrraba;1534721930.0;"The last guy took two weeks. This one has passed that mark already."
e4htcv3;aciou;1534758793.0;"no, we don't want him."
e4hu2yh;jagermitchell;1534759521.0;"As the official ambassador for IRC, I claim him for us."

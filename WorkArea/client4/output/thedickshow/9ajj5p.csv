e4vwc6y;tommy_twofeet;1535351458.0;"I'd like to know where these screenshots are coming from, and more importantly I'd like to see the archives. As much as I want to see Maddox go down in flames I have to still take all of these website shenanigans with a huge grain of salt. It is incredibly easy to fake all of this with just a saved copy of his site then editing it and posting screenshots. That's why we need to start seeing archives before going on a witch hunt. Last thing we need to do is get trolled by one of Maddox's cronies."
e4wleur;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1535383151.0;"Im in the camp of these weird changes being some sort of false flag perpetrated by Maddox so he can fabricate evidence that Dick is doing nefarious things. Its entirely within his character."

e4x38r8;MacChuck234;1535410502.0;"Clearly the work of the hacker known as "4 Chan.""
e4x4012;UghImAWriter;1535411206.0;"lol @ maddox faking hack attempts"
e4wiey9;rusted-nail;1535377469.0;"/u/dickmasterson it would be a good idea to try and keep an eye on how many people got free access to the livestream from this horseshit considering you're now talking about suing George. I'm sure youre already doing that though"
e4wphvj;buffer_overfl0w;1535392265.0;"I imagine that Maddox is going through server logs and I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't filtering content by IP or doing some sort of geo-fencing. "
e4x3emk;MacChuck234;1535410651.0;"Maddox, you dumb son of a bitch. You pulled something similar and everyone immediately figured it out last week. But you are just barreling full speed ahead. YOU FUCKING RETARD. WHY????"
e4yc8fc;Lospantaloons;1535452078.0;"Oh man, he really burned Dick with the "err's, umm's and standstills" comment! PWN3D!!!!!"
e4w2jch;ItCameFromWeston;1535358257.0;"You don't even need to save the website, you can edit your client side html directly in your browser with developer tools."
e4vx8tc;SnakeJerusalem;1535352434.0;"> Last thing we need to do is get trolled by one of Maddox's cronies.I absolutely believe this is the work of a troll, and Dick should know better than to fall for it"
e4w1x7l;Ashanmaril;1535357596.0;"That one message that was like "biggest problem is next" or whatever it said, I definitely saw more than 1 screenshot of that."
e4wcatd;naught_so_clever;1535368913.0;"Check out my screens.."
e4x6sfl;tommy_twofeet;1535413723.0;"That evidence could easily be disproven in court. Either they just need to look at the server logs or contact the ISP to get their history."
e4why85;TheFlyingBastard;1535376677.0;"Assuming this is legit, not only are they unoriginal, they can't even do the "uncucked" joke right."

e4wapiz;No_Nuts;1535367110.0;"One of his fans was on the livestream chat. He said he was watching on Madcast Media."
e4wc5j1;naught_so_clever;1535368744.0;"It really happened. "
e4xysf7;StealtHigh;1535438230.0;"Who is this "4 chan"?"
e4wkvlv;naught_so_clever;1535382034.0;"I thought of this as well.Luckily, though, every single livestream has a different and unique url...Its almost as though this scenario (or something similar) was thought of in the beginning...HMMMMM......."
e4yc4jm;c0ld--;1535451965.0;"Archives do exactly that. Copy the HTML sent from the server and archives it to a trusted 3rd party. Editing the client-side does nothing, unless you're trying to doctor a screenshot (which is not what a website archiver does).Do you even know what is an internet?"
e4vzpzc;DickMasterson;1535355156.0;"Oh ye of little faith!"
e4wbuiq;naught_so_clever;1535368392.0;"It was real... Whether trolling or not, this legitimately was on the madcast website and people showed up from madcast. "
e4w3whh;Leons_Hair;1535359734.0;"I'd assume it was edited by someone at some point and Dick just jokingly said he was going to serve notice when he seen it in the vein of Maddox"
e4xh97p;twistlock;1535422800.0;"I saw that message live on the site."
e4x2byv;Sectswulf;1535409652.0;"Seems to be picking on Dick for the "ers, ums, and standstillls," so I'd have to assume its actually Maddox. Who else would autistically obsess over minor quality control (that arguably makes the show feel more intimate and human) while ignoring audio quality and content. It doesn't natter that you take the time to clean up your horrible reads, you bald stuttering fuck. Your content is boring garbage. "
e4wj0wy;naught_so_clever;1535378542.0;"EXACTLY!! "
e4wmcdr;rusted-nail;1535385159.0;"I dont follow, are you saying each patreoni gets their own url or he can tell from youtube's analytics if someone is watching without paying? I also seem to remember George telling people how to pull the bonus content from vimeo like a year ago"
e4yptqi;Kanzel_BA;1535472548.0;"Don't go to Greenland over this or anything, but he's talking about the "It is incredibly easy to fake all of this with just a saved copy of his site then editing it and posting screenshots" bit. I.e., you don't need to save a copy of the website to edit it, you can do it directly and screenshot the results far more easily than that. The comment has nothing to do with the archive you're sperging out over.In summary, don't jump the gun next time, and remember to get raped."
e4w4uep;Scrotaltent;1535360753.0;"the trolling is coming from inside the house"
e4wj1c0;gme186;1535378563.0;"Is the madcast site linked to the rss feed as well? Did you change the thumbnail in the rss metadata?:))"
e4wbwen;naught_so_clever;1535368451.0;"It was real. "
e4x4v9w;TheFlyingBastard;1535411999.0;"Right. The stuttering wasn't even interesting. It was the way he cut whole swaths of the show to make himself look better.And aside from that, Dick is doing live shows. Everyone can see if he screws up on stream. It's not being hidden. The whole premise of the joke is clearly lost on whoever sets this up."
e4x4tih;madoffyousagoober;1535411956.0;"And the live streams are just them recording the audio and video that will be cleaned up for the actual release. It is not supposed to be some kind of perfect live broadcast. $20 patreonis essentially get a weekly behind the scenes early release. That's the way I've always looked at it."
e4xbgci;naught_so_clever;1535417811.0;"Each week/episode has a different url, not each patreoni gets a unique url, sorry if that wasn't clear. Like next week it will be different just like this week was different from last, but I assume we're all getting the same link."
e4yylci;c0ld--;1535488534.0;"My point wasn't even shot that high and it still managed to go over your head. It was like a lofty pitch. The kind you barely throw so that little children swing at and feel some sort of sense of accomplishment. And if you even had the intelligence of a child, you could grasp at that concept. But no. I had to bring up the complex idea of what is an archive and for some reason you can't seem to shake the notion of some nefarious goss actor who will do the unspeakable act of \**gasp** falsifying information by using a doctored screenshot. Gee, if only there was a way to verify the integrity of the information brought forth. Oh, I know! What if there was a website that copied the data from the webserver (you know, the source), and gave people a link to view a copy of that data, knowing that whenever it was copied, a high level of confidence could be placed on, that the information being viewed is, in fact, a legitimate copy - and not some hard-on using the inspector tool and taking a screen shot.  We'll call it an ~~archive~~ copier site!The whole point of archive sites is to post a link to a reputable 3rd party copy, not about grabbing at each other's dicks about using the inspector tool and taking screenshots. Pull your head out of your rear hole, you dense mother fucker. Go fuck yourself. "

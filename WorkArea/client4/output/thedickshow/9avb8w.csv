e4yeyq6;No_Thot_Control;1535455116.0;"I doubt Dick will ever get married."
e4yee0p;RealMildlyPoisonous;1535454473.0;"If he did Maddox would probably break and try to crash the wedding on his bike and an Californian open carry licensed sling shot to try and bring everyone there to Greenland with him.  "
e4yvphc;FireballWhiskey26;1535484617.0;"Maddox would crash the wedding with his “elaborate disguise” that he bragged about on BP"
e4yeogt;Grand_Admiral_C;1535454800.0;"He would probably send infinite text messages when he found out she left the song with Dick because doubling down will eventually work. "
e4ygk7v;SperglockHolmes;1535456991.0;"We can only dream."
e4ym5ra;AlexWyvern;1535465270.0;"What are you, 12?"
e4yibvi;DoodSalamander;1535459244.0;"Nah he won’t need to. Maddox will go to Greenland on his own. "
e4ykpm6;NumberEightySeven;1535462775.0;"If Dick get's married, his wedding should be a block party on the same street Maddox lives in."
e4z8ab2;oedipism_for_one;1535498134.0;"Not at all. Can you imagine a greater cuck fantasy then they guy you have been trying to get revenge on for years not only fucking the girl you love but marrying her? He would have the best orgasm of his life."

e4zr00g;Arcticfox04;1535514020.0;"Nope he'll go back to Utah and become a Mormon. He'll start a new podcast called The Biggest Mormon In the Universe and run TV infomercials around 3AM."
e4ykusb;buffer_overfl0w;1535463001.0;"Nah he would crash the wedding with a boom box on the front playing the intro to his podcast. Then Maddox will start flailing his arms screaming: "80s girl come with me, I have room for both of us on this seat"."
e4yf0c4;No_Thot_Control;1535455167.0;"Doubling down is the preferred tactic of leftists, and it always works."
e4yq19m;Kanzel_BA;1535473010.0;"Wrong. He'd fly in on his jetpack and try to woo 80s girl with the stolen crown jewels, fresh off his penultimate heist."
e50e24k;Giradox;1535535047.0;"He'd get in there and just start dancing by himself. "

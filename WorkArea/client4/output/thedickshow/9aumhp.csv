9aumhp;Basherballgod;1535447716.0;Maddox officially lying about download numbers.
9aumhp;Basherballgod;1535447716.0;"Following on from my previous update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDickShow/comments/97auv3/best_debate_numbers_update_since_we_like_the_stats/?st=JLD0OG6L&sh=2244708b) where Maddox announced they hit 3.5 million downloads, this week Maddox has announced they hit 4 million downloads.Since the stream subs were lost due to Dick reclaiming his feed, there is no possible fucking way that Maddox the liar would get 500,000 downloads in 2 weeks. Maddox, you are straight up lying now. "

e4y827z;Terrahex;1535447803.0;"I mean... rape list...We already know he's a liar."
e4y85jj;JMC266;1535447897.0;"I mean it's basically public record that he's a liar. The whole perjury thing."
e4ydx6i;NumberEightySeven;1535453960.0;"571972 x 2 people voted on episode 113 and yet he only gains 500,000 more downloads. Now I know why he failed that math exam three times."
e4yco5l;BioDomeWithPaulyShor;1535452582.0;"I don't listen to his show so I don't know his download numbers, but I'd assume that he'd say "With over 3.5 million downloads" for a couple of weeks until he hits 4 million."
e4ygcuk;RobotOverlord328;1535456742.0;"Maybe I'm obtuse, but if he started saying 3.5 million on episode 105, and 4 million episode 115. That would mean he's claiming 50,000 downloads per episode? So not 500,000 in 2 weeks but 10. Now obviously he's lying but not to as high a degree. "
e4yb2yh;Grand_Admiral_C;1535450879.0;"Meanwhile, TDS hit 5 million how long ago?"
e4ynmgt;The_RedWolf;1535467986.0;"In other news, Maddox is a cuck"
e503dp4;RobotOverlord328;1535524839.0;"I figured it out. I'll bet you he just added the archive Biggest Problem numbers to his total downloads for the current show. That would explain the sudden giant bump in numbers. Half a million total downloads on that feed in the last 2 years isn't really that much of a stretch. I think that's where the discrepancy is. "
e4y8sk0;SnakeJerusalem;1535448554.0;"I actually think he deserves the benefit of the doubt. Don't forget that the trolling from the other week must have caused a significant spike in downloads. There is probably even some residual spike the following weeks just to see how Maddox reacts to this whole thing. I wouldn't be surprised if that was enough to push the count beyond 4 million."
e4ybv11;The_Atticus;1535451684.0;"In the most technical sense, nothing in the video was a flat-out lie, just immensely misleading and cherry-picked to imply a certain narrative. He did this on purpose; if anyone confronts him about any particular statement he can explain how it's technically true, and then deny the underlying implication. The vast majority of friends from his social circle are not familiar with the background of BPITU and will generally take what he says at face value, so when he says a sentence like "His show's own message board maintains a rape list", they'll interpret that sentence the way it was obviously meant to be interpreted: His show has a rape list. However, if you confront him about how it doesn't, he can simply say "The Dick Show's 8chan message board clearly has a rapelist up. I didn't say anything that wasn't true".The W in The Alphabet of Manliness stands for Weasel."
e4zgzip;Madoffyouseabitch;1535505601.0;"Maddox couldn't even finish a degree in lying."
e4yf6mv;688as;1535455363.0;"And how much sooner have Dick hit 5 million if he had stolen the iTunes feed. "
e4y8uxq;Basherballgod;1535448624.0;"500,000 in 2 weeks? The biggest month in TBPITU didnâ€™t even have that. "
e4yix9o;juiciusmaximus3;1535460049.0;"How do you come to the conclusion that nothing in the video was a flat-out lie? I mean even the line you quoted:> "His show's own message board..."is a lie."
e4yf0or;688as;1535455178.0;"This is the "implying" part of "lying and implying". "
e4yqxx1;WheresTheButterAt;1535475083.0;"Who knows if TDS would have gotten as huge as fast if Maddox hadnt turned his entire fanbase and the entire TBPITU fanbase on himself?Id assume incredibly successful still because Dick is a great content creator, but without all this goss I just wonder where the show and the community would be? "
e4yc16g;Linrraba;1535451865.0;"500.000 no but the dick trolling might have brought some spike in downloads for Maddox. People wanting to check that out."
e4yxrva;The_Atticus;1535487516.0;"An 8chan board can be called a message board, and it is for "The Dick Show". It's not "his" message board, but "his show" (The Dick Show) has a message board. I'm sure this is one of the things Maddox and Saenngh spent three hours arguing in circles about. Why else would he phrase it so vaguely (message board?) and weirdly ("maintains"). "
e4yg0rz;Basherballgod;1535456340.0;"A spike of 50k, maybe, but not half a million"
e4yyh5a;juiciusmaximus3;1535488394.0;"The issue isn't in calling it a message board. The lie is calling it "The Dick Show's own". There's a big difference between the phrasings, "the show's own message board" and "a message board for the show". Also, "message board" isn't vague, it's what all internet forums were called back in the day."

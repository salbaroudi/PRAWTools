e4yn4qx;kdrama_addict;1535467037.0;"Bullshit...his YouTube AND twitter?"
e4ytiw2;BobPley;1535480726.0;"Metokur's channel is back!"
e4yopmh;PersonMcGuy;1535470150.0;"Oh Kraut is back at his faggotry? Well that makes a whole lot more sense than Google and twitter targeting someone like Metokur specifically that's for sure. I mean we all love Metokur but he's hardly some Alex Jones type big name but a bunch of but hurt e-celebs using co-ordinated mass flagging to fuck him over when they have a history of it? Entirely believable.Edit: [Oh look, the very first frame of Kraut's return video is a tweet referencing metokur, yeah it totally wasn't him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu07npsiATI) Rofl, and now Kraut trying to pretend he didn't dox anyone and people ganging up on him were just profiteering, fucking shameless."
e4yp46c;SperglockHolmes;1535470992.0;"Mundane Matt should flag Kraut out of existence as a part of his redemption arc.EDITNow his Facebook is gone."
e4yucx6;MySexJunkSmells;1535482323.0;"His channel is back now!Weird how they would terminate an account for only ~4hrs.'you're such a despicable piece of shit you aren't allowed to sign up to our service, you fucking cunt, go fuck yourself''actually we've decided you can use our service now'"
e4ystqa;scott_zoloft;1535479294.0;"so what else are you into, bud"
e4z4gmb;Lpup;1535494668.0;"my money on who the flaggot is would be Laura "the dumb boomer" Loomer. Metokur went for a round two tango with Loomer and her dirty bloomers, and there are always ((coincidences)]) with white knights coming to defend m'lady Laura and her tires.Then again Jim was firing full clips at all agenda peddling journos.It could be any one of them, or all of them. If Wikileaks taught me anything its how often these pussies collude.As funny as it is to blame Matt, I think he was too busy making his child push boulders to do this one."
e4yuiv1;BadLaziesOn;1535482619.0;"Just checked my subscriptions, and Metokur is back for me. I can play his videos, see [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfYbb7nga6-icsFWWgS-kWw), his 255k subs are there.I'm not a youtube, I don't really know the system, but I think he has been reinstated. So hurray, and fuck report spamming."

e50czbq;SneakyMcGeee;1535534043.0;"I cannot fucking stand this asshole. He sounds like he is in a constant state of smugness. Every word begins with a pause, every statement is a rhetorical question, as if he is sucking on a real sour dick and about to giggle at his own fucking shit. Hate this kiwifarms/ encyclopedia dramatica shit that the show has become. We went from a show about a guy talking about manly things to fucking chris chan and mundane matt every week."
e4z4csy;NumberEightySeven;1535494569.0;"I love Metokur but I can't feel sorry for him. He put all his eggs in the YouTube basket when he should have been building up an audience on BitChute. YouTube/Facebook/Twitter/Apple Store only has this power because people are giving it to them. Stop using these cuck platforms."
e4yzsdd;BobJWHenderson;1535489912.0;"Boo.  Fucking.  Hoo.  Look at me playing the worlds tiniest violin.  "
e4yq6km;personn5;1535473341.0;"His Facebook got hit too now. "
e4ypwp8;sweetb00bs;1535472728.0;"Kraut? as in bausch the bratwurst guzzler?"
e4zi9ak;PragmaticGrizzly;1535506683.0;"Someone still had to vet the account closure."
e4z1rol;poorlytaxidermiedfox;1535492044.0;"That's because his channel was taken down automatically, or maybe by an intern. A review showed he didn't break any rules so it's back. Flaggers won't have such an easy time getting his account disabled next time."
e4ytli5;wauterboi;1535480870.0;"When Chris-Chan was super popular, there was a dude named Anthony LoGetto or whatever his name is. This guy became infamous for obsessing over making fun of Chris-Chan as if Christian were an immoral person that deserved to be hated to the fullest degree, and that by publically hating on Chris-Chan he would be a better, funnier person. In the end Anthony drew negative attention to himself (because Chris Chan was socially awkward and mentally disabled, not a bad person wtf) and became a lolcow.Being an A-Log is acting like Anthony LoGetto. In this case, it's obsessing over Mister Metokur to the point that you flag all of his content at the sacrifice of your own free speech principles, which would draw attention to yourself should you ever be caught"
e4z3heq;kdrama_addict;1535493746.0;"His YT is back up, but Twitter is still down"
e4ypyde;PersonMcGuy;1535472836.0;"I don't know the reference. He's some sperg from the "skeptic" community."
e50dljb;Stiffalis420;1535534621.0;"shit man... I've been a Christorian for a long time. Never head of Anthony LoGetto, I'll have to look into him. Thanks for the explanation... Also, I'm sorry to hear about your dead cat. "

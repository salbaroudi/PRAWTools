9afe0u;countjulian;1535317611.0;"Hello fellow Dick Heads,I am a Dick fan, and former Maddox and TBPITU fan who's just now catching up on the goss since a hiatus that started in early 2015. Which episodes of TBPITU, TBSITU, and TDS are absolutely essential for the goss and lolz in general? "

e4v0cc9;AlexWyvern;1535318829.0;""Dick on Maddox (18)" came immediately after Maddox's rape list accusation."Unimaginable Stress" (77) was the first free post-lolsuit episode with "Dick on the Lolsuit" (bonus episode 18) went into more detail.During the lolsuit, these episodes marked notable situations (there might be more but these are what I remember):- 78: Stealing Shows- Bonus 19: Fans and Scrilla- 89: Getting Caught (Maddox's lawyer goss)- 93: Heather S (Maddox admits perjury)- 95: Chutzpah (Asterios' lawyer's funny defense)- 103: Maddox Lost (speaks for itself)Saga-within-a-saga; Maddox files a trademark for TBPITU, Dick counters. I can't remember where it's first mentioned, but Dick on The Trademark (98) is after Maddox loses.Caught Cheating (105) is after Metal Jess leaves Maddox.Latest episode, The Stolen RSS Feed (116) is about the recent goss of Maddox losing his feed.That's just the tip of the iceberg though. I'm sure others know more. There are also some good YouTube vids that can give you a synopsis of the goss."
e4uzs11;Sofa_Man;1535318080.0;"Start wherever you left off on BPITU, then listen to the dick show. Listen to it all unfold in order. "
e4uzzuo;Dantasticles;1535318368.0;"Yeah, you gotta edge your way through it, so you can have a huge beautiful nut when you catch up with reality. "
e4v9nx1;Everschlong69;1535329301.0;"All of them"
e4v4juu;metroids224;1535323957.0;"All you have to do is watch two podcasts, pretty easy. "
e4vhedb;Ben2749;1535336843.0;"It’s an awful lot to get through, but you should listen to all of The Dick Show from the beginning. It’s well worth it. I started listening around this time last year, and got caught up a couple of months ago.It’s a great show, and not just for the Maddox stuff, though that is one of it’a highlights."
e4wd53m;NextBiggieThing;1535369901.0;"when i get around to it i want to timestamp all the old episodes so people can track the goss easier"
e4wip5h;kaizervonmaanen;1535377963.0;"The Dick Show is like a Mexican telenovella where every week Maddox, the creepy ex of the main female protagonist, have some dumb Wile E. Coyote plan that sometimes looks like it might do some damage before it fails spectacularly except it hurts himself (or our sweet patreon.com/asterios so it's not only a comedy but also a tragedy)The most fun is just to take week by week and be surprised. Or else a lot of the jokes will pass you by. "
e4vml7c;johnnybmcabe;1535341822.0;"This video helped me understand. And in only 2 hours and 45 minutes. https://youtu.be/ledktlPYTVk"
e4v0gbc;AlexWyvern;1535318974.0;"Also look at Rekieta Law's YT vids on the lolsuit for detailed breakdowns from a real dickhead lawyer."
e4v5m4g;FuriousNapkins;1535325126.0;"Also Dick on Court (55) when mental jess gets her restraining order and bonus ep (21) Kevin landaus multiple DUIs."
e4vhu1j;Laysfordayz;1535337269.0;"Episode 55 is when Dick talks details on the restraining order."
e4vr3t4;CameronMcL;1535346153.0;"Ep50 and its corresponding bonus episode is where Dick first talks about someone calling up 80s girls school."
e4v04q4;Grand_Admiral_C;1535318548.0;"Yeah, for full effect, you can't beat chronological order.You might consider listening to BPITU episodes from http://uncucked.thedickshow.com, unless you want to go through twice for comparative purposes."
e4vit8w;Ashanmaril;1535338223.0;"Or restart BPitU with the uncucked feed!"
e4w3ig2;metroids224;1535359303.0;"It's not that bad, I started listening to TBPITU and TDS after that in June, and finished mid July"
e4vmvyg;countjulian;1535342110.0;"I've already watched that"
e4v28iq;Sofa_Man;1535321287.0;"Oh yeah definitely listen to these. All of the cut content is good one way or another. It might not make sense until later, but you wont regret listening to this version over the other!"
e4wnq8v;m1serablist;1535388270.0;"I was gonna suggest this but since you already watched it you are mostly covered. just go on and listen to dick show, because there are a few hilarious things that weren't covered in that video, like maddox's shit lawyer's shenanigans."

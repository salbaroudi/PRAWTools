99fctk;TomTuff;1534988022.0;"Accountability check for /u/dickmastersonDon't pull a fasteriskck whales. #Pics of last modified date or it didn't happen. "

e4n8cir;DickMasterson;1534989768.0;"Shit! Sorry. Thank you."
e4n6dmk;SnakeJerusalem;1534988160.0;"In Dick's defense, he is a considerably busier person than Maddox, so I would not judge him at all if he took a long time  to complete his next book."
e4ndyi6;Teddybearsyrup;1534994368.0;"Also limited edition signed hard covers, I'll pay any price /u/dickmasterson"
e4nrzup;buffer_overfl0w;1535006221.0;"Instead of a book Dick should create a musical or a play about this whole thing. The thing should consist of 3 acts.  **Act 1:** They are all recording the The Best Podcast in the Universe, Maddox singing about making snacks. The wedding and finding out Dick went home with his ex (80s girl) being all heart broken. Thus destroying the podcast.**Act 2:** Maddox singing about the rape-list, new show and how much being a cuck isnt actually a bad thing. Xoean leaving him. Then trying to ruin people's careers; getting Kevin "hold my beer while I put this in gear" Landau involved. **Act 3:** Maddox loosing the lolsuit, Mental Jess leaving him, pretending nothing had actually while being butt-hurt at the whole internet for calling him names. I think if Harvey Weinstein was still in charge of Miramax this probably would be put into a film."

e4oo9le;chronus_poo;1535048013.0;"Someone needs more hot chicks watching him."
e4n8p9g;tefloncondom;1534990056.0;"If I can pre-order NSFW sometime in the future I certainly will. Looking forward to it."
e4pvzwv;The_RedWolf;1535089700.0;"Honestly this one line means far more than any of Maddox’s delaysThe acknowledgment that he hasn’t worked on it as much as he should have.That’s a man accepting responsibility."
e4n703h;seabiscuity;1534988669.0;"Yeah he's actually at a top position at his company and still manages to be a  content machine. Goes to show he's actually invested in his comedy to spend his leisure time doing this. And he makes bank doing it. "
e4npmac;juiciusmaximus3;1535004089.0;"Well he's not Mexican, so he's not lazy."
e4nlg1h;buffer_overfl0w;1535000529.0;"How can Dick work more than 13 hours a week? 13 fucking hours of editing and making everything. I'm surprised Maddox has the time to play Dark Souls"
e4ndy85;brotality_;1534994361.0;"Furthermore, he makes more on Patreon each month than Maddox has made in total from Fasterisk Whales."
e4o4dud;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535018028.0;"He'll pay any price and he's buying one for me. Thanks."
e4nykf4;HardForkCafe;1535012385.0;"I'd fly to Broadway to see this musical and pay Hamilton prices"
e4o5gwe;TomTuff;1535019116.0;"gfy"
e4nfvnw;BenadrylPeppers;1534995927.0;"I thought he was part owner or something?"
e4nwcjd;the_plots;1535010254.0;"Somehow this stereotype has changed and most people now think mexicans work hard is the stereotype."
e4nnqnq;No_Thot_Control;1535002475.0;"13 hours of editing is basically a major Hollywood film once a week.  Not to mention the time he spends preparing the snacks."
e4nm90o;seabiscuity;1535001210.0;"Cofounder it looks like (which typically implies part ownership), but that's what I meant essentially. I think he's CTO and there's really no upward direction he could go from there other than assuming a different, but equally valuable role. Point being, Dick's basically the bourgeoisie and runs shit while Saddox is too stupid to even monetize the dead content that collectively amounts to his "career." Dick runs circles around Saddox's entire life for fun in his off-time."
e4ni6iw;Pussy_Ponderer;1534997813.0;"I’m pretty sure he is a part owner and also has an executive role in the company"
e4nzo8y;Bottleroach;1535013451.0;"And on the cheap."
e4nu612;BenadrylPeppers;1535008220.0;"It's a pretty great setup, I'd be lying if I said I weren't jealous.Not that jealous of legal bills and general Maddox shittiness but.. still. Man's got his life mostly together!"
e4o4ca4;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535017985.0;"Maddox couldnt even be fucked to set up a twitch schedule, the lazy fucking bum."
e4ornzd;DoodSalamander;1535053736.0;"And the chicks.  If I didn’t love the man so much, I’d hate him."
e4of6cn;ragnathorn;1535030756.0;"He had to sacrifice his intestinal fortitude in exchange."
e4oiyte;BenadrylPeppers;1535037105.0;"Also permanent hangover."

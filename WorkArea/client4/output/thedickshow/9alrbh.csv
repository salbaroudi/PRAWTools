If you wanna start something, do it and get a handful of people who enjoy trolling to join you in the fun, then show pictures of said fun and watch more people pile on till its a dead horse.Comming here and asking people to do it sounds like asking for re enforcements for your personal army, which people here will just shit on you for.on a side note, I think its funny that the way boomers read the hashtag me too movement is "pound me too""

9aju7n;aneurysm34;1535353335.0;"If anyone listened to the WhoAreThesePodcasts episode about TBD, they talk about how sad it is that Maddox's voter participation has gone down so drastically in the last couple years. So I go to check it out, and there are now five times the number of "people" participating in his stupid fuck show than what WhoAreThesePodcasts said. Who am I more inclined to believe. A podcast with a manipulative and compulsive egomaniac liar, or one with people who were genuinely funny and had shit to say? I look at the bottom... not one single comment, yet so much participation elsewhere. I smell some bullshit.Anyways I leave a comment. How do I hide my work and personal info on FB :')https://i.redd.it/c3l5gdciqii11.pnghttps://i.redd.it/42c328ciqii11.pngâ€‹"

I didn't take screenshots, but on the 2nd day Cuck Sockers had 500 votes, then a couple hours later they had 200, and Hazencruz shot up from 200 to 700. So anything Maddox tells his audience this week is a lie from him, not the Dickheads."
e4w6l5y;RobotOverlord328;1535362638.0;"Then when the numbers evened out there was a big fuckery with the voting again. I guess Maddox really hates Uncle Buck. "

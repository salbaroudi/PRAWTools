9b2cj7;AshnCompany;1535515987.0;Anybody got "fuck college" stories
9b2cj7;AshnCompany;1535515987.0;"Syllabus week is not the worst thing colleges do. Let's give Dick a sample of the other bullshit they do.  My college just announced that "Premium Majors" have to pay more tuition. Also "Premium Majors" are just any major that could feasible make money, especially business, engineering, and nursing. A woman tried to defend this practice to me. I wasn't having that shit because I am engineer with an MBA whose dating a hot asian nurse. This idiot told me that the business and engineering departments demand more money because they generate more revenue. I told her that that makes sense. She recoiled and said (I shit you not) that the dance studies and humanities departments get too little funding as it is, and charging the other students more fixes it. I explained to her that the departments should get funding proportional to their pull, and followed it up with "if the dance department can't keep its own lights on we should just get rid of it." I found out later that she worked for the humanities department."

e4zvezu;CompanyYesMan;1535517744.0;"Was in a shit grad program with too many students nodding in line with professors’ personal opinions. One prof I didn’t agree with continued to grade my midterm and final with Ds. I was asked to redo most of the work for her course, but because of the way the percentages worked, I could skip redoing any of it and end with a C-. This wasn’t against the program policy, but did bring my overall program GPA around a C+. Admin scheduled a department meeting with my supervisor, advisor, and the chair. As they lectured me in raising my quality of work, I made the decision. They then asked if I had anything to add. Sure did. “I’m resigning and leaving this program effective immediately.”They freaked out and turned their tune, asking if there was anything they could do to retain me. I stood up and walked away. My cohort called several times over the remainder of the program duration. The next year the program was visited by their national board. Shit was a mess, and they were put on probation for five years. At any point they fucked up in that stretch, they would lose all accreditation. "
e4zu8ds;Mastrrbasser;1535516741.0;"Went to private college and it cost a lot of money. The best professors mentioned all the schools they work at to make ends meet, one of which mentioned that they also teach at public state universities. I asked him if he used the same power point at all the schools he teaches at. He said yes. I asked several other teachers the same thing. They also said yes. I transferred to state school. One thing that happens is that older teachers get tenure and refuse to retire. As a result, a lot of the younger professors KILL themselves working as adjunct professors (with no benefits) across the entire state. When I was told this, I went to the cheaper school. I was a commuter anyways, so who cares how nice the dorms are?"
e4zvhky;CXMetalX;1535517805.0;"I'm from Europe so going to college (or rather, university) is not as much as a scam as it apparently is in the US. I did not pay a lot for my degree and even then I still received government support.There's still a lot of bullshit though. (People from) humanities departments seem to have a major inferiority complexes and complain a lot about lack of funding and not being taken seriously enough vis-a-vis the hard sciences. I think one of the reasons for this complaining is tjat the universities themselves are one of the few institutions that could theoretically employ people with humanities degrees - to do research. So it makes sense their students and professors keep insist on more funding: it's the only way they can get a job or keep their job. Personally I studied law but later switched to economics. My law classes seemed a little bit like a scam. I had almost no classes and got almost no homework.  Meanwhile my yearly uni fees were the same as that of students of medicine, biology, economics and engineering students - who had classes five days a week more or less full-time. At the time I was very happy slacking off but looking back I paid but didn't really get any education for it in return."
e4zyah9;FireballWhiskey26;1535520202.0;"I went to college in my later twenties while working full time and having “adult” shit going on. It made me realize how it’s basically high school 2.0. One time our prof was going to be absent so he appointed some girl to take roll that day and hit play on a movie or some shit. I left like half an hour early. The next time that happened, the girl “called me out” to not leave early.I lol’d."

e504k0q;jomb;1535525918.0;"Graduating a year and a half past my peers because some of my credits I took at community college didn't transfer over. So 2 years at community only saved me 1 semester if I just went straight to university. Yes I still have to pay for that. "
e4zyofg;Pestosterone;1535520537.0;"I've been trying to go to college off and on for many years. If you don't follow the trend of going straight from high school to college it seems to be very difficult. My high school lost my file and when they eventually found it they hadn't updated it to say I had graduated. I had to go there over and over to get to the point where I could start filling shit out for colleges, just to then find I'd need some other piece of paper or something for them only after paying their application fee and being notified I was missing something."
e4ztu9w;JMC266;1535516416.0;"Don't go, college is a money pit. Jobs want real world experience, not a degree from expensive day care for adults."
e4zunkm;heavycharcuterie;1535517092.0;"So tuition is like 4K and they send you a whole email about you being able to get back some money from optional tuition fees, turns out the only optional tuition fee is the 2$ one that funds the ability for students to be able to decide what tuition money is used for."

e500nde;VGToasty;1535522289.0;"50 cent a page printing. Report needs to double spaced, single sided, and had to be bound by the library with a laminate cover before you can hand it in. Binding costs $30. By the time all is said and done my shitty business HR report cost me like $80. Highway fucking robbery. "
e503hmu;yeahRIP;1535524942.0;"My first semester, they scheduled two exams in my program for the same time. There's been a lot to complain about over two semesters, but that's what stands out most, along with just how often the foreign students get caught cheating, only for nothing to be done about it. In two semesters, I've had one professor who would actually do something, and even he was pretty easy on them."
e506uwj;ShockinglyEfficient;1535528089.0;"Dipshit professor in a dipshit field forcing us to buy the dipshit textbook that he wrote, and the dipshit book is riddled with spelling errors because he's a dipshit"
e508ai4;JAUNNNTY;1535529458.0;"Doing an MBA at a decent university. 1/4 through I have this sinking feeling that I'm just being sold an extremely expensive piece of paper. They're just pumping idiots through the system and milking them. Where I'm from you don't pay for shit up front, it just sits as a govt debt that you slowly pay off based on your income, so its easy to get people to enroll and get them through because it doesn't pose an immediate financial consideration for them.  Decide that I'm getting 0 out of this course,  I already have a piece of paper, don't need another one for the sake of it. Decide to finish mid semester.  At this point I have 48/60 for the unit I'm doing, with a 40 mark exam coming up. So essentially I need 2/40 on the exam to pass the unit. I decide not to go, don't want to get to the end of the unit and accidentally sunk cost fallacy myself into continuing the course, I just decide to make it a clean break. Get a text message a couple of months later with my final score, 50, passed, found a couple of marks behind the couch or something. Confirmed my world view. Just getting iidiots through the system as quickly as possible."
e50bk6j;chronus_poo;1535532685.0;"My very first course in college was an 8am chemistry class. Should be straightforward. The professor used the first half of every single class to rant about bullshit that had absolutely nothing to do with chemistry. Some highlights: bagels will kill you, don't lift weights, and always wear a hat. Eventually I just started showing up 30 minutes late every day because it's not high school so at least they don't take roll."
e4zxgo4;IonicPaul;1535519500.0;"This isn't from the institution side, but older adults (from their 30s and up) who think the class is a conversation with the professor. It'd be one thing if they had something useful to contribute, and every once in a while they do (broken clock etc.), but they just comment on everything, usually not even raising their hands. Shut the fuck up."
e506e1u;ShockinglyEfficient;1535527650.0;"Oh great! How did you stumble on your great career?"
e503lli;yeahRIP;1535525043.0;"Same situation here. There's a college and a university in this town, and most of my professors work at both and use basically the same material so why would I spend thousands extra to go to the university instead?"
e5015z6;Teddybearsyrup;1535522759.0;"I hope you then threw a brick at her. That seems an appropriate response "

e50a7gm;HottestManGravy;1535531368.0;"I went to UC Davis, a college with an emphasis on agriculture, and got a degree in farming ass.   Not a lucrative field, but rewarding nonetheless.  "
e5020ai;BloodFartTheQueefer;1535523550.0;"A friend of mine had a similar problem. They screwed up her transcript and she had to go through a great deal of effort for them to fix it... don't know if she ever got the final one."
e4zyzbr;JCDchameleon;1535520805.0;"College is only a money pit if you throw excessive money at it. Work hard and get scholarships to public school, community college, etc and it's basically the price of a car except it actually appreciates in value"
e4zz7le;Madoffyouseabitch;1535521011.0;"You need a degree for a lot of professions unfortunately. I say unfortunately as the degrees offer very little practical experience and often require subsequent professional degrees/diplomas to practise ie law"
e4zy6di;vxOblivionxv;1535520106.0;"Exactly. Nothing has humbled me more than getting what I thought was a top degree in a thriving business field, only to find out I was better off just spending that time working instead of wasting my time and money. College is a scam. Nobody gives a fuck about your fancy piece of paper. Why should they? They have 100 candidates that have proven experience in the exact same position."
e500zcv;BloodFartTheQueefer;1535522590.0;"Sometimes. In Canada colleges typically refer to the places that give 2 year diplomas. Easier to get into but also usually more hands-on and to the point.Universities focus more on 3-4 year degrees (not diplomas) and hire professors to do research rather than just teach (though the focus varies school to school)"
e501miz;Kincaid86;1535523191.0;"Also, in addition to /u/BloodFartTheQueefer, Colleges are often areas of study WITHIN a university. E.g, The College of Architecture at the University of Texas"

e501xd9;BloodFartTheQueefer;1535523472.0;"ya, that's a confusing element as well though there is technically no relation as far as I know... just a weird naming convention"
e50ahxm;IonicPaul;1535531658.0;"It's not a business meeting. In a class of 40 people, where the professor is going through something involved, I'm not going to interject like a self important cunt. I raise my hand so he can come to a reasonable stop, or hell, finish answering someone else's question. If there's a natural silence, sure, but there often isn't. My dick doesn't get smaller because I raised my hand."
e506lta;ShockinglyEfficient;1535527851.0;"This is the kind of mentality that makes you older retards so annoying in class. You're not smarter just because you're old. Shut up and listen like the rest of us."
e50cfms;ShockinglyEfficient;1535533523.0;"I'm sure mega geniuses like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates are skewing that data a little bit"
e50conp;lurkaderpasherpa;1535533758.0;"It's clearly not a business meeting, but if you struggle with the concept of interjecting and interrupting to serve your own purposes out of fear of being 'annoying' then avoid them at all costs in your future. Maybe become an elementary school teacher and bask in the view of all those raised hands.On the flip-side I've lost count of the times where a professor asks questions of the class to see if they are following along, or understand the concepts, only to be met with walls of silence. Usually the one answering all the time gets pegged as the obnoxious asshole when all they want to do is hurry the class along.  Waiting for natural silence from a professor, that's a good one. All the more reason why you should interject. Timid little bitches. Yeah the old-timer is an asshole who annoys you, but they are getting what they want out of the experience of being in that class. You're just sulking like a little bitch, with your hand raised. "
e506skg;lurkaderpasherpa;1535528027.0;"Sorry, you didn't raise your hand."
e50d5fi;IonicPaul;1535534201.0;"What? These people are literally asking for validation a lot of the time, or bringing up tangentially related info. I have no issue with asking questions if they don't understand, and sometimes they do - and that's fine. I raise my hand and get called on when it's not easy to interject. I already said that I'll interject when it's appropriate, but sometimes you can't without cutting them off, so I raise my hand so the professor doesn't have to start over and waste time.And if it weren't a big class - or, say, a business meeting - I'd be much more inclined to interject, because it'd be much more involved. But it's a big class, so it can't be. When I get unlucky enough to have a few of these fucks in my class, it will literally grind to a halt as they interrupt the professor's answer to the other questions with their own anecdotes or opinion on something that doesn't matter.This puffing up and "sorry you can't stick up to yourself" condescension at a very specific annoyance is baffling and hilarious."

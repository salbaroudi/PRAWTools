99jt5q;kaizervonmaanen;1535022455.0;The easiest thing to do in life is to not end up as Maddox, noone should feel sad for him.
99jt5q;kaizervonmaanen;1535022455.0;"After Dick made his 'artistic differences' explanation that presented both as being equally at fault (even though Maddox acted like a petulant child in the last episode) it would take a total idiot like Maddox to show how everything in reality was his fault. But that is exactly what he did.He went through all the effort to make a '#dicklies' video with the most easily debunked lies possible as his explanation. And Maddox was so low IQ that only after he made the video did he realise that all his lies were easily debunked so since then he tried to avoid giving any side of the story at all.He then spent tens of thousands of dollars creating the dumbest and most ridiculous lawsuit in the universe. (and he will likely continue making legal problems for people until Asterios counter-sues him) With no chance of ever being won.He used SJW tactics to get people fired from their job. All the things happening to Maddox is great, he deserves much more than that. He has not even paid back a fraction of the suffering he has given. So if anyone knows a way to get back at that asshole then let us laugh a righteous laugh when something worse happens to him. He has not even paid back a single dollar of the legal costs, he hasn't even gotten retribution for almost any of the harm he has caused.1 will laugh for years whatever happens to Maddox. He fucked up his own career with no help of anyone else."

e4oarj4;Spacemangspiff;1535025011.0;"I feel bad for Chris Chan because he’s retardedI don’t feel bad for Maddox even if he is retarded "
e4orm24;jahvidsanders44;1535053662.0;">He used SJW tactics to get people fired from their job.He went even beyond that. Most SJWs just stick to Facebook campaigns and Twitter hashtags to browbeat businesses into firing people from afar.Maddox straight-up sued someone in court for making fun of him. That is way, way worse. He's worse than an SJW."
e4o90f7;SnakeJerusalem;1535023017.0;"It its not just the fact that Maddox is still to pay even a dollar of the legal costs of the people he fucked with. He is still to be seen as the absolute scumbag that he is by his peers. His popularity is  fading, sure, but his reputation is still in good enough of a shape amogst his libtarded social circle. The morlocks know very well that he is a lolcow, a dumbass, and a scumbag... but it will only be when his peers look down on him, cut him off, and leave him with no other option but to go back to Utah and find a real job that he will finally feel the consequences of his actions. I honestly think it is the only thing that will make him wake the fuck up, because it is abundantly clear that he does not care about money, and he will always find a way to hehe away from financial burdens."
e4ofh4q;PersonMcGuy;1535031196.0;"Maddox could teach a master class in how to always make the worst choice possible."
e4optgr;sp441;1535050877.0;"It's pretty fucking amazing that all this chaos started because Maddox _did_ something. Actual fucking inaction would've been much better."
e4ol4d8;m1serablist;1535041393.0;"Even if he does go to greenland tomorrow, i would feel no pity towards him. He is a cunt. This is not about the show either. Anyone who worked a career job knows this, you go to work every day, try to be better to end up in a better place in the end. And maddox fucks with that for the tiniest things, because he is a weasel cunt. Lying, shameless, weasel cunt. "
e4orlrs;scott_zoloft;1535053649.0;"what is the significance of calling someone soyless and wanting them to go to greenland bc soy isnt bad but it doesn't go in every meal it really depends and greenland is probably worth a visit? Idk seems indicative of some more sinoster brain thing going on"
e4oinru;Stiffalis420;1535036554.0;"It's been a long time now and I can't remember... Was the Dicklies video a response to something specifically Dick did? I don't remember him saying much up until then. "
e4ovasi;AllahHatesFags;1535058208.0;"Maybe someone should do the toothpicks and superglue to his door lock that I mentioned in another thread."
e4os77u;jahvidsanders44;1535054471.0;"There's a cliche but it fits here: Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.I can't wait to see what stupid prizes are in store for Maddox."
e4og272;armoured_bobandi;1535032092.0;"I think if this all ended after #DickLies, I would accept the "Being retarded" excuse.  After that though, the sympathy starts to wane considerably "
e4ozcfy;sp441;1535062197.0;"Thing is, Chris Chan harmed pretty much nobody but himself.Maddox hurt a _lot_ of people on his way down."
e4on3fn;kaizervonmaanen;1535045549.0;"> He is still to be seen as the absolute scumbag that he is by his peers. I don't know why the pedophiles and dr. Nurse who know about the shit Maddox have done still support him. Must be something wrong with their moral compass. Who would have thought that those people were such moral degenerates."
e4ove6t;AllahHatesFags;1535058315.0;""No, no, dig UP stupid!""
e4pacc2;kaizervonmaanen;1535071667.0;"What on earth, what degenerate downvoted our Scott zoloft? "
e4oj7i1;portuguese-charlie;1535037557.0;"I’m not 100% sure on this but I believe bits of information had been floating around of Maddox talking about Dick, how unprofessional he was, things he did, etc, and people constantly messaged Maddox because he refused to give an answer but eventually a thing or two slipped. Not long after, I think Dick started to openly talk about it on the show until the \#DickLies video came out then all broke loose. "
e4okal9;rockthemullet;1535039696.0;"I don't know if there was a specific thing that caused Maddox to go the #dicklies route, but before that, the only things dick really mentioned was being upset about the stolen iTunes feed and him releasing the bonus episodes. Outside of that--and maybe a few throwaway joke comments--Dick kept things professional and just said they had artistic differences."
e4orrzh;jahvidsanders44;1535053891.0;"I think it came right after Dick mentioned the stolen iTunes feed on his show."
e4on0g1;kaizervonmaanen;1535045372.0;"It was a response to Dick saying that theshow ended due to "creative differences" (in other words due to unresolvable disagreements). The #dicklies video starts with Maddox claiming that the show did not end due to that. And then he makes up lies which would also be "creative differences" if they were true."
e4oo233;kaizervonmaanen;1535047589.0;"I think if this all ended BEFORE #DickLies, I would accept the "Being retarded" excuse.After that though, the sympathy starts to wane considerably. I lost all respect for him when the #Dicklies video was released.But he has done much worse things since then of course. Maddox should also pay for the potential loss in revenue from the jobs he lost Dick and from the Pizza Hut ad that they didn't send."
e4pv2ml;Spacemangspiff;1535088850.0;"Exactly he’s going down kicking and screaming "
e4p2cwt;ShockinglyEfficient;1535064856.0;">pedophiles Keep hearing this. Who's the pedophile?"
e4psl8x;FireballWhiskey26;1535086659.0;"Is everyone forgetting about Maddox going around on Twitter saying he had information to ruin Dick’s “personal and professional reputation”?"
e4ovjhy;SnakeJerusalem;1535058472.0;"No, the stolen itunes feed was mentioned either around episode \#2 or \#3, whereas \#dicklies dropped just before episode \#17. The reason Maddox gave to having released his video was because of the alledged targetted harrassment campaign caused by Dick talking about some stuff like the itunes feed, the bonus episodes, Mental Jess having shared Asterios messages, etc."

e4pa5bb;kaizervonmaanen;1535071508.0;"Several of them moderate his libestreams and so on. Like Tito and clegg. It's not just one. "
e4quro2;Stiffalis420;1535135700.0;"good call... That sounds right to me. I have been trying to remember what started it all for a while. Thank you."
e4psuxz;portuguese-charlie;1535086891.0;"Oh yeah... that was one of the highlights at the beginning of this feud. Should have mentioned that. God, 2 years feels like so long ago."
e4oxshu;jahvidsanders44;1535060742.0;"Man. The goss was so tame back then."
e4soabk;FireballWhiskey26;1535202366.0;"No problem.It was one of the first things that changed my thinking from this show."
e4quqv2;Stiffalis420;1535135659.0;"there has just been so much goss it's hard to remember all of it. "

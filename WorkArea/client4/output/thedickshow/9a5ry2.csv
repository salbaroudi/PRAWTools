9a5ry2;MCdumbfakealiasname;1535220624.0;"[SONG: SUICIDE KING by MC DFAN](https://soundcloud.com/emceedfan/suicide-king)(The song is named after someone and their career trajectory)I'm out of material to rip on Maddox with. There's nothing left to say. He's too embarrassing for words and the best thing he can do is quietly die in obscurity.So, expect a downtown Los Angeles public freak out I guess?Don't end up like the broken, walking parable, that is George Oozy.He could redeem himself if he could stand down the truth of his fuck-ups and acknowledge them. But ol' Saddox just is too stubborn for that.Burn his books, then let's all do our best to forget him."

e4hqxa7;Tamrowski;1534756210.0;"Well yes it's still mistakenly labeled comedy"
e4hmu51;SnakeJerusalem;1534752071.0;"A few hours ago I was able to see more than 100 reviews giving it an average of a single star, and now there are no reviews whatsoever, at least for me."
e4hnek5;FireballWhiskey26;1534752633.0;"Still seeing a 1-star average"
e4ht95l;TomTuff;1534758683.0;"The answer is "yes" to both. Maddox is definitely up to more under-handed shenanigans, but not this. "
e4hul8d;jibmob;1534760073.0;"Appropriate advisory warning. No obe should listen to it ever"
e4iiflo;vAxAv;1534798222.0;"I jist looked at the madcast website and Zach Waldman has two out of his last four podcasts with women breastfeeding in the thumbnail. Nothing wrong with breast feeding. Always wierd to put it on the cover of something...twice. is this ZW's version of clickbait? Kinda creepy."
e4i6azm;buffer_overfl0w;1534775739.0;"What's not funny about someone debating straws by themselves. "
e4hvqoh;Arcticfox04;1534761289.0;"Well yeah it's based off his real life."
e4ho1mm;NumberEightySeven;1534753300.0;"Is he able to remove comments from the feed?"
e4ifpbd;Bankrupt84;1534794517.0;"I made a review on this new channel fuck that. Ima let everyone know what this show is really about on itune"
e4hnfla;SnakeJerusalem;1534752663.0;"Good, might just be me then"

e4ij3ek;SnakeJerusalem;1534799032.0;"If there is something that has become abundantly clear about MCM is that it is a shady, shady organization. The world would be a better place without it, even if by a negligible margin."
e4jq8qj;FireballWhiskey26;1534843603.0;"That guy’s Patreon is still at 0.I guess none of the 906 people who listen to Saddest Debate on iTunes care enough about the “network”."
e4ifguc;BenadrylPeppers;1534794155.0;"That's a comedy like A Serbian Film is porn."
e4hpq9i;Basherballgod;1534754988.0;"He can probably appeal to apple about “false negative” reviews and show screenshots from this sub reddit. "
e4hz1kx;BobJWHenderson;1534764879.0;" Not manually but I think he can flag comments he doesn’t like.  "
e4hqjr9;PUTTY1;1534755839.0;"Yeah it’s all there. Maddox is fucked, no one is going to listen to a 1 Star podcast "
e4lbasi;CivicPlaza;1534911805.0;"Pure conjecture but Id be willing to bet he gets less than 900 real downloads.If youve ever not unsubbed to a youtube channel because it went inactive, this should make sense to you. Plenty of inactive youtubers still retain hundreds of thousands of subscribers who areinaactive or just didnt unsubscribe for whatever reason. Same holds true for podcasts, people who 1. stopped listening to the old show and didnt unsub, or 2. stopped listening to podcasts much after the show ended, would still be subscribed to the Feed which Maddox stole.One of the iOS podcast apps features is auto downloading the latest content from shows you are subscribed to. Inactive but still subscribed users phones will auto download the episode but never listen.I figured this out because when Maddox hijacked the feed I started using sticher to listen to old BPITU episodes since they werent on itunes anymore. I just didnt use the podcast app much. Low and behold a few weeks later my Phone is low on storage and a ton is from my podcast app, because my phone had autodownloaded a bunch of maddoxs garbage show on the stolen feed. I think this feature is default as I dont think I ever enabled it or anything.This would be a reason for maddox to steal the feed, auto downloads regardless of what he put out, which would appeal to sponsors.Some more evidence is user interaction, it would make sense if Maddoxs show had 1/3rd the participation that Dicks show has since Dick has ~3x the downloads, but Maddoxs show does not recieve *any* online discussion at all besides his twitter account. Meanwhile the Dick discord, reddit, and facebook are all active communities posting and discussing. Activity does not match the download rate at all. If we can get analytics from his new hijacked feed we might see even fewer than 900 downloads as he wont get the old stolen feeds autodownloads in the same way he doesnt have any of BPITU’s five star reviews."
e4i2ngu;Stiffalis420;1534769733.0;"That would suck if he were able to do that... Even if basically all of them came from fans of TDS, I doubt very many (if any) of them are false. I gave it a review solely based on the episodes I have listened to and what I thought of them. "
e4ic0la;AffirmativeNod;1534787775.0;"I don't get that at all. "False" negative? Most dickheads know the podcast, and have tried listening to it at some point. I did. And halfway through episode 32 I stopped listening is because I truly considered it to be unlistenable pig shit, and after 31 episodes my opinion can be considered *informed*. But even 2 or 3 episodes are enough to have an opinion. If 95% of his former fans think that way, how are these "false" negatives?"
e4ibtul;NumberEightySeven;1534787366.0;"He's a cuck and a flaggot."
e4i65h8;re_dy;1534775461.0;"I think a mature podcast with "not enough ratings to display an average" is more damning that a bunch of one star reviews."
e4ic178;Basherballgod;1534787811.0;"It was a reference to the lolsuit, where Laundui brought up false negative reviews"

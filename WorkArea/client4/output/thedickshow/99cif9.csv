e4mjjik;ChaosCowboy;1534966642.0;"The part where the guy says "but" and Dank stops it to exhale some cigarrette smoke and say there it is was very satisfying for me"
e4mz72v;PlutoIs_Not_APlanet;1534982391.0;"This is not the same point Dick made during that rant. >I am absolutely fine with there being social consequences to the things that you say. I am *not* okay with there being *legal* consequences for the things that you say.Dick said that there should be absolutely no consequences to the things you say, which is outside of the scope of the 1st amendment and why Sean was not on board and called him out on it."
e4mspq9;lord_teknokratus;1534976868.0;"Tell your dodgy solicitor to make submissions on free speech next time Dank instead of wasting your time with other low level YouTube grifters."
e4mpgp4;BobJWHenderson;1534973758.0;"This wasn’t funny when Dick bitched about it for 30 minutes and and it’s not funny now. Kill yourself. "
e4mndj4;ozzie_ozzie;1534971569.0;"I probably should've time marked it there actually. Here is 10:56 for the quick fix.&#x200B;[https://youtu.be/Fk82ZMYoP0U?t=656](https://youtu.be/Fk82ZMYoP0U?t=656)&#x200B;"
e4mskrg;BenadrylPeppers;1534976742.0;"Hey, look, he's still posting. Why don't you just talk to yourself IRL?"
e4n1i1u;ozzie_ozzie;1534984252.0;"Yes, there is the dilemma.​Private business vs. individual speech. I've worked for prominent companies that expect my social media to be in line with company policy - and as an employee and sometimes customer/shareholder, I believe that makes sense - up to my personal beliefs.​If you disagree with a company's policies that much you are antithetical, you should get another job (or be a hypocrite). Similarly to an employer firing you. But the pendulum has swung way over to the virtue signalling zero tolerance which means Zero Discussion.​Now, we have complete deplatforming. Erasing of any discussion by the cabal (Dick's post). Social media is the new town square. On the internet due to the proliferance of the social platforms "they are a private business and can do what they want" is horse shit. I don't watch/care about Alex Jones but it is pretty obvious "newspeak" is being propagated by these monopolies and "wrongspeak" is being silenced.&#x200B;How can it be that if I think something I can't say it online? This is an existential threat to Reason.​\#LickTheBoot"
e4neq1g;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1534994981.0;"Well there shouldnt be social consequences for things you say. They're not actions, and thus not deserving of consequences. "
e4n67va;johnnysteen;1534988029.0;"Actually Dick didn't say "should" or "should not" absolutely, just that if there *are* social consequences to what you say, your speech is not free.It's not difficult. If you want to fire someone for what they say, that's your prerogative, but you cannot also say that you value free speech."
e4mpsoj;FiveSmash;1534974091.0;"Yeah I don’t get Dick’s point ranting about people saying “it’s a private business they can do what they want.” What’s the alternative? They shouldn’t be allowed to fire people who say things they disagree with? That’s retarded so I don’t think that’s his point. I think it’s really about the Mob being the problem, but he doesn’t make that very clear."
e4nrrwx;PlutoIs_Not_APlanet;1535006020.0;"Well both you and Dick disagree with Count Dankula then. Which was the point of my post. That aside, what exactly do you consider to be a social consequence? "
e4nhqbv;PlutoIs_Not_APlanet;1534997444.0;"When people in American discourse are saying "Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences" they are talking about the First Amendment. When Sean described the 1st amendment and said "That's the law", Dick said "It needs to be more". I would consider that to be a "should".If you want to define FoS as something that isn't legally protected in the USA then fine, but I think that is unhelpful to the debate when most people are not using the same semantics. And again, Dank said "I am absolutely fine with there being social consequences to the things that you say." Whereas Dick is clearly not on board with that."
e4myqit;DickMasterson;1534982020.0;"There's no such thing as a private business. Every business is subject to massive government control and influence and these content publishing companies specifically are a protected class under the law. They are now leveraging their protections to achieve political goals, and they have been doing it since the stupid Net Neutrality shit started. Hell they've been doing it since the telephone was invented.Part of the problem is people defending them, blaming advertisers and "stock price" red herrings, but the main problem to me is the entire point of having a telecommunications network and safe harbor laws--to increase communication between people, spread ideas, blah blah blah--is being subverted and diminished by a cabal of tech companies. These companies similarly abuse patent laws and tax loop holes, driving innovation down and taxes for the middle class worker up. They're evil, full stop. But none of that is funny. The parrot thing is funny. It's not funny to everyone, but it's not funny to some in the way that makes them aggressively "not angry". That's the sweet spot for me."
e4mu9on;LePontif11;1534978266.0;"With Alex Jones for one, neither YouTube or any other company cared about the very public things he said for years. All of a sudden a bunch of companies huddle up and erase him from the relevant internet. It looks like their and their advertiser's complaint boxes got filled with Alex Jones bitching so they felt like they had to do something. To me it looks like the problem is people not the companies, we just don't seem to like freedom of speech as much as we say we do so we take it away ourselves since the government won't or can't. "
e4n0yyk;chronus_poo;1534983824.0;"Private businesses can also put those fucked hand drying air blowers in their bathrooms. They shouldn't, but they can."
e4mq14n;BobJWHenderson;1534974323.0;"Dick bitches way too much about this shit. You should see his twitter. He acts so self righteous when it comes to freedom of speech but I feel like he only does it to be contrarian. He’d defend pedophilia if it meant pissing of people on the left. "
e4obubs;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1535026307.0;"Job lynch mobs and being accosted wherever you go thanks to people like Antifa and representatives who encourage people to harass others for their beliefs. "
e4p77ca;ozzie_ozzie;1535069060.0;"Dank is literally being persecuted for free speech. Scotland and Canada have lost the plot.In general society (i.e. USA) free speech should be accepted by society as a social norm, not denigrated due to "offense". X34n is being a legal literalist, Dick is speaking to how society *should* view public speech which would then affect business actions.Dank is in the trenches. Dick is speaking idealism. This isn't disagreeing, this is reality vs. what our society should attain. Yes Dank accepts he can no longer get a job - but on a human level, is that right for a joke that mocked his gf?"
e4p5lln;ozzie_ozzie;1535067599.0;"The societal construct here is the problem. Yes businesses have rights, but society is just sucking ass at this stage. You think any late night show would have George Carlin on these days?"
e4qg6nl;johnnysteen;1535110538.0;"Most people are wrong, that's the point. Words matter. Free speech is free speech, first amendment is first amendment."
e4n805q;FiveSmash;1534989488.0;"The problem is that people put up with it. They want the Twitter safe space, or at least don't care enough to do anything about it. It's entirely feasible to escape the bootheel of the tech cabal, or at least some of it, but 99% of people don't see the value in decentralized alternatives, so they'll never succeed because they can't compete with the user experience."
e4p2umz;phase_lock;1535065274.0;"Funnily enough, some recent tweets by Cody Wilson have indicated that he's against net neutrality regulation. If there's one guy I'd expect to have the technical knowledge to know what NN is, and have an interest in not letting telecoms block his legal content based on "corporate speech" by the ISP or hosts, it'd be him. If you get him to call in again I'd love to hear you discuss this."
e4n0kd4;Skrongman;1534983501.0;"I actually wouldn't mind all of that so much if they just came out and said "we cater to X because we make more money from them", so you could make a legitimate informed choice, but acting like they're doing it for the greater good can get super raped."
e4mv44z;FiveSmash;1534979013.0;"I agree - that's the sad truth of the matter. If people cared about free speech, they would've flocked to Gab the second Twitter banned anyone for wrongthink.That's why I don't even think Twitter should be considered a "de facto public forum." The vast majority of users clearly don't want it to be that, so why force it on them? Have your safe space for all I care."
e4muq8m;HeWhoPours;1534978666.0;"bro you're fucking retarded"
e4o76e6;ROSCO577;1535021042.0;"People on the left love pedophilia so I doubt defending it would piss them off. "
e4opxe3;PlutoIs_Not_APlanet;1535051063.0;"That sets the bar pretty high. When Maddox put out the dick lies video and everyone stopped listening to him, was that not social consequences for speech? Are you not okay with that? What about boycotts?"
e4pg0uv;PlutoIs_Not_APlanet;1535076277.0;">Dank is literally being persecuted for free speech. Scotland and Canada have lost the plot.I agree. I hope it gets overturned.>X34n is being a legal literalist, Dick is speaking to how society should view public speech which would then affect business actions.The people who say "FoS doesn't mean freedom from consequences" are talking about legal literalism as well. Interpreting FoS to be outside the scope of the 1st amendment is sidestepping the argument. That's why Sean kept saying "I still think you don't get it".>Dank is in the trenches. Dick is speaking idealism. This isn't disagreeing, this is reality vs. what our society should attain. I suppose a better phrasing is they're not making the same point, Dank is responding directly to the question (which was misapplied by Peanut in my opinion), whereas Dick is off in the weeds arguing about platonic ideals.>Yes Dank accepts he can no longer get a job - but on a human level, is that right for a joke that mocked his gf?I think that if he were never arrested, this would have blown over by now (when was the last time Justine Sacco was in the news?). On that basis, I find the legal ramifications of the case to be far more important than the social ones."
e4n1uhv;DickMasterson;1534984529.0;"I don't think they make more money catering to anyone, but they do gain more political advantage by colluding in these acts of censorship. Even something like banning Gab; it's obviously against the public good and doing so eliminates a competitor, which is always bad for us--and it's also already illegal, but no one seems to care because they're obsessed with fighting racist Bogeymen. Their businesses exists on a set of laws they benefit from, but then exploit for political power and control, but again no one cares. Hence the idiot parrot. These same companies spend massive amounts of money on lobbying. Why? It's not for our benefit. They're building their own set of laws on top of ours and eventually they'll win. The cable companies and the phone company did the same thing. Everyone's service suffered for it."
e4n4s5a;ozzie_ozzie;1534986879.0;">If people cared about free speech, they would've flocked to GabWhy don't you go post your opinion in [www.no-one-can-access-it-cos-we-dont-allow-it.com](https://www.no-one-can-acces-it-cos-we-dont-allow-it.com).Disingenuous much? Maybe you're ignorant of the silencing - I'll give you that. There are no other platforms. Even Dick tried."
e4muuhd;BobJWHenderson;1534978770.0;"Okay. "
e4p47j5;EBP_ReviewThePS2;1535066433.0;"It was a social consequence, a social media mob went after Dick because of lies. My response was simply examples of some consequences, it wasn't meant to be all of the possible consequences.Boycotts are different because people boycott actions by companies. The kind of secondary boycotts we see now that are intended to undermine people's advertisers is very damaging."
e4n2ci9;Skrongman;1534984935.0;"By "make more money" I guess I meant "make themselves the monopoly", so yeah, I agree. Political lobbying in Australia is less transparent than in the US, I think, so I tend to err on the side of voting for the party who tell you up front they're going to fuck you, because at least you can pre-lube your asshole. The same should go for "public utilities", IMO."
e4nntjd;lord_teknokratus;1535002541.0;"It's not as if anyone didn't see this coming though. I remember going to a talk by Stallman 7 or 8 years ago now where he said we'd all end up useds of facebook. I don't know if the answer is removing safe harbour protection, because then you give a whole bunch of other shifty copyright holders control. Probably the only solution at this stage is hitting one or two of them with a big antitrust suit to get them to divest. That's the problem with Gab - it's not illegal, it's because there's not enough users leaving Facebook and Twitter, and quite frankly the platform is garbage."
e4n6fo4;FiveSmash;1534988207.0;"They don't care enough to do anything about it. You can access Gab in the browser on your phone. If you care about free speech in social media, you'll do that. Most people just don't."
e4oa8ps;SuburbanYute;1535024407.0;"the answer is simple.force them to abide by the 1st amendment. "

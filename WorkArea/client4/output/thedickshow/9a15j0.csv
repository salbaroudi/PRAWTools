9a15j0;OmegaX11;1535173296.0;Anyone interested in an audiobook MABTW reading?
9a15j0;OmegaX11;1535173296.0;"I just was kicking this idea around and I've been getting into doing audiobooks lately anyways. Just threw a recording of the intro together and wanted to know if any dickheads wanted to hear the full book to be able to play on the go, or, for those who've never read it, a way to listen. I do a bit of voice acting so if the tonality isn't to the masses liking I can alter it a bit./u/dickmasterson interested? I wouldn't release your book without your green light. Even if you aren't the internet police. I'd rather you focus on the podcast and content rather than do the reading we all want, but I'd love to do this for the fans.Edit: And I definitely am a fucking idiot. Here's the link: https://soundcloud.com/user-682391355/mabtw-intro"

e4s0ywe;aciou;1535176362.0;"i'm conflicted between the quality of your reading and the degeneracy of your profile picture."
e4sj3mr;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535195578.0;"Yes, but I think we all want Dick to record it. You have a good voice, but it's a little monotone in the delivery of the jokes, not because you're not good, it's just a different kind of reading style that's required."
e4sux6s;ludwigavaphwego;1535215069.0;"Only if Trump reads the line about your father."
e4ryo4i;TheChickOfDestiny;1535174168.0;"I’d kill someone for it. iirc, there’s some copyright issues though."
e4xnlwo;Gabrahamsandwich;1535428327.0;"N for furry avatar. I'd rather hear it from Dick Masterson."
e4s318g;MAGAmanBattleNetwork;1535178380.0;"Sure, why not, go for it.  Hell, I've thought about popping a few adderalls over a day and reading the whole fucking thing in one go.  Would be fun."
e4s3mpb;m1serablist;1535178986.0;"*AY AM DIE OUNER AND THE KREATOR OF THE SITE MUNDANEMATT IS A PHAT PHAGET DOT COM WAHAHAHAHAHA* I probably rewinded that part 15 times, everybody in the studio just dies, it was the funniest thing dame pesos ever said."

e4s4dam;Loggerheading;1535179731.0;"Gross. "
e4s298r;Phteven_j;1535177606.0;"came here to say this"
e4s135l;OmegaX11;1535176475.0;"Thank you. IRL fursuits creep me the hell out if it makes you feel better"
e4t1e6s;OmegaX11;1535228838.0;"I know, we all do. We should all also know he probably never will. I could spice it up. I just want people to be able to hear it on the go."
e4rz2uw;OmegaX11;1535174547.0;"Couldn't tell you. I'm willing to record it though. I'll just put it on the secret internet black market"
e4siugp;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535195285.0;"I dunno, Dick tells people to go to book stores and pretend to be Dick Masterson. Where's the copyright in someone just recording a reading?"
e4s3di9;aciou;1535178720.0;"it doesn't"
e4s3wpk;downvote_syndrome;1535179266.0;"no, stay away from anything furry-related. it's too fucking weird."
e4s1kx3;seabiscuity;1535176954.0;"Hope you posted this behind 7 proxies because the internet police are probably already on their way to your house as we speak otherwise."
e4sj0ez;TheChickOfDestiny;1535195474.0;"Idk. That’s why I left it vague. I don’t remember the specifs "
e4t1hbf;OmegaX11;1535228974.0;"I work in the music industry and know a fair bit about copyright, I'm sure the publishing house has some kind of lean on the title and rights to produce derivative works. Going to stores and pretending to be him is a little bit different. It'd practically be the same as making an ebook version and distributing it for free."
e4sisu6;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535195231.0;"You make me feel better. More music pls."
e4sjsp0;aciou;1535196395.0;"comments like this make me feel better. you may not know, but a lot of my time is being dedicated to my shared music project with /u/lakembra and /u/samglaze, [Hard Men Working Hard](http://patreon.com/hmwh). you might find songs from me there that you haven't heard yet. you might find [this one](https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-song-party-20447966) of particular interest, as well as another song we'll be releasing on wednesday. i'm also working on a remix of [mundane rap](https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-song-mundane-20883034) that should be coming out soon."
e4slq3n;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535198772.0;"Im a patreoni and a fan since I first heard your work. Do you have any unrelated Dick Show material I can buy or listen to? I know a few of you guys had some stuff, but I cant remember all of them."
e4snpec;aciou;1535201497.0;"oh, legend. so far it's just my [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/aciou) and [orfium](http://orfium.com/profile/aciou), but you probably know of those. lakembra's told me a few times i should put an EP out or something, an idea I've entertained a few times but have made no push towards. aside from that, there isn't really anywhere else i've made my stuff public."
e4snsbb;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535201617.0;"Please do an EP. "
e4soepq;aciou;1535202552.0;"okay."
e4sogg6;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1535202625.0;"ty, ily no homo"

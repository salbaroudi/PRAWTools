You provide me with neither.Kindly sudoku, far away from me."

e4stqrf;rusted-nail;1535212391.0;"Agreed. Politics has not a lot to do with TDS and what it's about and you can scratch that itch most other places on the internet. I prefer the show being about Goss and e-drama in general, but the show is really about how Dick's life and friends are the most interesting. All the other shit is a bonus"

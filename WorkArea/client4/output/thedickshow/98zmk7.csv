e4jx75i;PersonMcGuy;1534852478.0;"What is audio balance? Jesus fuck you're not supposed to keep the music so loud you can't hear shit christ. "
e4jwzy3;pi_over_3;1534852256.0;""Today we are going to debating 'what's the best female fashion trend'" with a panel of 4 dudes.It's so cringey"
e4jv3kz;SnakeJerusalem;1534850230.0;"It actually kinda starts promising when he acknowledges that he now has close to zero downloads, but then he totally pusses out of it like the weasel that he is."
e4jweir;NumberEightySeven;1534851610.0;"Episode 113, The most talked about and highest number of views ever.Episode 114, 11 people are watching live."
e4jy2td;Hawkstream;1534853509.0;">Today we're here to have funBetter late than never, I guess."
e4k0733;N0Taqua;1534856203.0;"I .. I can't even believe it. I've never listened to a single second of his post BPITU content, until now. I cannot believe how shitty the audio is, and him trying to talk over that horrible"metal" for his intro... I fucking can't believe how gut wrenchingly awful those 10 seconds of his show was. Does he really have listeners? Any at all?  "
e4k27nd;DoYouKnowofMe;1534859117.0;"Oh boy! I can't wait to hear a room full of 40-something men discuss women's fashion! Your downloads will stay near zero with that kind of garbage content. "
e4jvkr0;Family-Duty-Hodor;1534850721.0;"He's hoping that if he puts off talking about it long enough, people will just forget about it. Something something Smash Bros video"
e4jz87h;Mr-Scurvy;1534854926.0;"It's going to take him weeks and weeks to expertly craft an explanation."
e4jvkrr;boedo;1534850722.0;"Where did you get this from? I thought he deleted it. Also, a couple of minutes later he redid the intro with the music at a lower volume level. "
e4jw205;RazorCandies;1534851233.0;"Its genuinely interesting to me if his cohosts know or even care about any of this. They probably heard the hijacking last week. They probably know at least a little of what Maddox has done Are they just piggybacking on his dying influence? Or do they really not care about everything he's done? Are they inept? I just can't understand it. "
e4jv070;ForceWave-1139;1534850133.0;"How do you steal something that was stolen from you?"
e4k4xso;AlexWyvern;1534863734.0;"How cringey is the air-guitaring, camera-mugging manlet, though?"
e4ka089;NumberEightySeven;1534874293.0;"https://youtu.be/wUNK9jbcWbw?t=50m20sMaddox addresses last week's voting. Ron Babcock and Taylor Nikolai are just holding their tongues with blank looks on their face."
e4k4kv9;elvoggo;1534863069.0;"Oh man them all "rocking out" to the intro is the dorkiest whitest thing I've ever seen. "
e4kaksi;Bankrupt84;1534875458.0;"He will never discuss it or talk about or give his fans some insight as to what happened.  But people won‚Äôt forget about it. I hope they start asking. "
e4k0a31;sweetb00bs;1534856319.0;"hE ALREADY EXPLAINED. #DICKLIES remember? That's a check mate"
e4ka5mb;fratstache;1534874597.0;"Was he even talking during that shit guitar intro?"
e4k07g1;688as;1534856217.0;"Maddox thinks he's gaming us and is pretending he's in control. "
e4kfaz3;chux4w;1534883288.0;"Guest looks like a knock off Madcucks."
e4kqgd5;MatsuMuhou;1534894405.0;"My theory: he isn't planning on addressing it on The Best Debate at all. If he is, there's no reason he wouldn't have addressed it in this episode. He's planning to make another rape list style hit piece video about the situation."
e4krbd1;MaybeIAmAFuckinIdiot;1534895111.0;"Lol what a fucking moron. Nobody can hear you idiots over the music Maddox."
e4kncje;BobJWHenderson;1534891745.0;"Ron Babcock and that little twerp next time look like a couple of faggots. "
e4kpq3c;dubb5ack;1534893793.0;"It still amazes me that he thought putting out the \#DickLies video would go well for him.  What a disaster his career has turned into."
e4kgid2;SpicyTonyPA;1534884976.0;"Yeah I totally heard what he was saying over the guitar rift. Quality post. "
e4knbe9;jeffykins;1534891718.0;"Such a goddamned trainwreck, hoooly shit"
e4l88ad;Thy_blight;1534909232.0;"Ah, the nebulous "later", best used in cases where the author is a giant pansy that can't think up anything on the fly this is of substance. I can't believe that guy was ever on Tournament of the Nerds... he's absolutely abysmal at off-the-cuff ad lib and he knows it. There's a reason he was only ever legitimately interesting in written form, when he could meticulously craft every word which could have taken months (to years) to construct."
e4k30pq;CastlePokemetroid;1534860378.0;"I thought for a moment he was going to turn it up louder, then explain what happened to the feed, then stop talking about it once the theme was done."
e4kbs0b;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534877705.0;"Tsk...I listen to metal. You clearly don't know that metal is supposed to be played at a high volume. What an indigent of music you are."
e4jyhh3;juiciusmaximus3;1534853997.0;"To be fair, the Taylor guy is practically a girl."
e4kffar;Icon_Crash;1534883497.0;"The fact that this is even a topic on a male oriented show is cringy af."
e4k0y0q;Pendacan;1534857249.0;"It's about what looks good, not what women think looks good."
e4knnqu;ShockinglyEfficient;1534892017.0;"Right?? Like if he owned how shitty his podcast was doing and the ridiculousness of the situation then he would be at least redeeming himself in some small way, but he's incapable of doing anything like that. "
e4m01t7;tefloncondom;1534935267.0;"He's avoiding direct confrontation. That's why he's skulking around doing shady shit behind the scenes. Shame really, Ralph invited him on the killstream and I would have loved to hear how that would have played out."
e4jxguj;Spacemangspiff;1534852788.0;"I love it.  Let‚Äôs guess em. Maddox sock puppet Tito CleggCatgurl Dr nurseI can‚Äôt think of anymore üßê"
e4kd6ie;DoctorMadcow;1534880025.0;"And I was one of them. (To see his intro, at least.)"
e4kd54x;Anonymous____D;1534879965.0;"Does the fun ever start?!?!"
e4leqdz;gme186;1534914661.0;"If he was like Dick he would have admitted what an idiot he was and made some jokes about himself.Offcourse this is maddox, so its ignore, double down, repeat."
e4k4yhp;AffirmativeNod;1534863771.0;"It's okay buddy, you're safe here. We have a Sean, and therefore, extremely good audio."
e4kk7cs;Ashanmaril;1534888849.0;"The audio is bad but it doesn't actually sound like this in the feed, this is the livestreamed version. The music isn't blaring over his voice in the version on the website."
e4lete9;gme186;1534914731.0;"To be fair: the orginal audio is much better. Ive checked because i coudnt believe it was this bad.Update: it seems the livestream was really this bad. "
e4jvxmy;ForceWave-1139;1534851101.0;"I was always thinking, was the Smash Bros video ever released? I think u/dickmasterson said that he was the one who sent it to Maddox, so perhaps he still has it?"
e4k3lzu;NumberEightySeven;1534861358.0;"I think it will be more like his 4th Bonus episode. He says it coming, but will never release it."
e4lolgd;Spacemangspiff;1534923800.0;"My ex lawyer/dog ate my podcast feed guys "
e4jvxcj;JMC266;1534851092.0;"u/absolutepotatopower had it on his Twitter."
e4jwrgr;JMC266;1534851993.0;"I'd say it's mostly because Maddox surrounds himself with spineless yes-cucks. It's a bunch of pathetic nobodies hoping to get a sliver of internet fame from a loser past his expiration date."
e4jx28g;Basherballgod;1534852326.0;"Taylor knows about it, as he has been tagged in on twitter numerous times to it. I was on the livestream as people were hitting him with questions about it. They Soft J started modding and deleting everything"
e4k3w50;NumberEightySeven;1534861844.0;"At first I think they stayed around because they got nothing else going on in their E-celeb career, and this podcast makes them feel they are a part of something. But I think that is starting to crack. From stories Dick has told about Maddox, and the bad parenting he had as a child, I think Maddox has a personality disorder and eventually drives everyone in his life away from him.For god's sake, if nothing else, his podcasts are set up to be confrontational with the co-hosts. You can't constantly argue against your co-host and not expect it to get more heated over time. It happened with Dick, it happened to Rucka, and now it seems like it's starting to happen with Ron and Taylor. "
e4jx0ae;Basherballgod;1534852266.0;"He didn‚Äôt say that someone stole it from him. "
e4lq9k8;sweetb00bs;1534925505.0;"All the air instruments in the intro brought tears to my eyes"
e4lfmmq;gme186;1534915429.0;"Funny how there are only positive and neutral comments, but lots of dislikes.Almost as if someone in censoring.."
e4l102s;Demplition;1534903150.0;" #DickLies 2.0. Dick Masterson is exposed as a child molester^^^apologist"
e4kbl2o;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534877363.0;"but in the real truth, he gaming he own self. poetry "
e4ktdyh;ketchup_pizza;1534896844.0;"Please do Maddox"
e4ln11q;SnakeJerusalem;1534922250.0;"That is also more or less what I am anticipating. He might very well talk about the itunes feed eventually, but it will be in yet another scheme to make Dick look like a monster."
e4k6lz3;DickoMcBrain;1534867090.0;"Nah that might have actually been funny, something Maddox hasn't been for a long time."
e4k14sa;BloodFartTheQueefer;1534857515.0;"That's not the problem, at least in my view (I'm not who you responded to). The problem is that 4 men would even bother having this "debate" and think it is interesting enough for a comedy podcast"
e4k3jji;NumberEightySeven;1534861243.0;"One was Dame Pasos. Soft J must have been in there. There were a few more Dickheads that saw it because they've already commented about it on another thread. The Live stream had to be at least 40% Dickheads."
e4k2729;Chukril;1534859090.0;"For TBDITU there was always a handful of dudes arguing with Dick with 5 dollar words in broken English who were too retarded to understand what satire was. "

e4kf5cm;theincourup;1534883017.0;"Who is Sean? Our audio engineer is Xshuehuean"
e4leuky;gme186;1534914760.0;"Oh the live version was this bad?? Damnnn"
e4jw3l3;DickMasterson;1534851281.0;"I posted it somewhere a while ago. I‚Äôll look for it again. "
e4jy8v7;juiciusmaximus3;1534853708.0;"It was definitely released because I remember watching it.Edit - here it is (lol dropbox): https://www.dropbox.com/s/z4suzfmygr0r1ev/smash%20bros%20fight%20at%20camp.mov?dl=0"
e4k0aah;688as;1534856327.0;"It was put up on the TBP website like 2 months after. "
e4kbfmo;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534877083.0;"The way he treats his co-hosts as employees is especially gross. He demotes and promotes them to silly titles to make sure they know who is in control of the whole thing. What a sick individual George has become. He's cynicism distilled into a sour, broken personality that only sees people as things in his life. Jesus, I'm never going to LA."
e4k7bg0;Ben2749;1534868577.0;"A lie by omission is still a lie."
e4jybn9;ForceWave-1139;1534853803.0;"Fair enough! =3 Though that‚Äôs probably how Maddox‚Äôs warped mind sees things."
e4m08zf;tefloncondom;1534935469.0;"Which would be funny indeed, seeing as he was the one defending pedophiles on the old show."
e4k2h3b;Pendacan;1534859525.0;"You're right. It does sounds like something Buzzfeed or College Humor would produce."
e4kdd6m;kaizervonmaanen;1534880295.0;"Sounds like me, was it me? "
e4kflo9;AffirmativeNod;1534883791.0;"Sorry, I always mystype that name."
e4jyixk;ForceWave-1139;1534854045.0;"Not seeing this had bugged the shit out of me. Now the bugging has ended. Thank you. GFY"
e4k1nrz;Wraith_GraveSpell;1534858284.0;"Even back in the day, maddox still lost."
e4kb7nr;TheFlyingBastard;1534876673.0;"Even rejects Dick's friendly manhug at the end. He just can't take his losses."
e4khwmd;FireballWhiskey26;1534886537.0;"Yeah, it‚Äôs not even a funny bit."
e4l8sdh;Thy_blight;1534909706.0;"He even said "This is the end of our friendship"... I don't think that was it, bub."

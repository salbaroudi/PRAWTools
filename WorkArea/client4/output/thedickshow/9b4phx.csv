e50e6dq;KansasCityChris;1535535158.0;"Whenever a project on Kickstarter hits their goal, they usually see a huge bump in backers and funding.  So I absolutely suspect there’s some fuckery going on here in the hopes that more people will back a successful kickstarter. I bet $571,972 that the people who are  smart enough to write crappy children’s books, and dumb enough to sponsor Maddox, came up with this idiotic plan. "

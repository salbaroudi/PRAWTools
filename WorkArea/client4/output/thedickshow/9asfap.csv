e4y464f;Bottleroach;1535443764.0;"The original Internet edgy boi singing the same tune as the establishment over McCain? Jesus fucking Christ."
e4xsjvf;Basherballgod;1535432385.0;"Didn’t they used to record in Maddox’s bedroom? And Mike Gamms was a guest towards the end of TBPITU"
e4xt75r;avnavar;1535432937.0;"Goss fuckery aside, how much soy does one need to chug to equate John McCain and Bin Laden?"
e4xr44z;UghImAWriter;1535431222.0;"this is a BUTT SEX joke"
e4xyrk0;chronus_poo;1535438206.0;"I thought it was going to be a setup for a punchline."
e4ye3ke;_SenzuriChampion_;1535454153.0;"The best part of this tweet is all the SJWs tearing into Maddox in the replies. Not even his new soyfriends are on board with this one."
e4ymbvk;NIPO_de_Clown;1535465574.0;"I'd explain to Maddox why he's wrong, but that 40-year-old boomer blocked me, so I'll just call him a cuck here because I know he reads this subreddit obsessively."
e4y6z14;ChaosCowboy;1535446674.0;"You either become an hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a boomer."
e4y52ap;Sressolf;1535444685.0;"McCain was an enemy of Drumpf, so Mainstream Maddox was naturally a fan of the senator."
e4yebz2;AllMight69;1535454411.0;"Lets not forget "christopher reeves WAS an asshole", hes fallen so far"
e4yjv3l;PragmaticGrizzly;1535461451.0;"People who have done complete 180s on who you thought they were are everywhere. MUCH more of them doing it so fast at the same time really stands out. Left, right, independents all pretending to care about his service and death when in 2008 they were making fun of him not being able to raise his arms from injuries. It all comes down to one question really, not skin color or ideology. Are you pozzed? I'm sitting here thinking up random people I used to know years ago and I feel really confident on being able to tell if they act pozzed now. You can just sorta tell."
e4xxb9n;DickMasterson;1535436757.0;"No, I meant it in a homophobic or cuckoldry way. Choose your own adventure."

e4xu3zs;KaiMeat;1535433740.0;"I guess I'm not progressive enough to not know the difference between Osama Bin Laden and John McCain."

e4y9cz8;PersonMcGuy;1535449144.0;"People hate Trump so much they'll throw away every principal they have to justify shitting on him. I mean that piece of shit supported the Iraq war but now that he's dead OH HE WASN'T A BAD GUY DAE HATE DRUMPF. Fuck those morons he was a piece of shit when he was alive and he's a piece of shit now, the fact that a guy who was tortured as a PoW would advocate for such a needless war shows how little integrity he had. If anything the dude should have been a staunch anti-interventionist for such a bullshit war not pushing to use the deaths on 9/11 to make his friends at lockheed richer. "
e4y5v7f;Bottleroach;1535445521.0;"I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say he isn't a fan of McCain. But that basic human decency shit and McCain **may** have been flawed? Fuck out of here. There's already too much whitewashing of his history and character going on, and of all people, Maddox should've been one to inject at least a little cynicism on the remembrance of McCain."
e4zm1e9;mawppp;1535509859.0;"I think it's more people who are somewhat aware and self-conscious of how left-leaning and politically intolerant they are so in their mind supporting McCain shows that they don't hate ALL Republicans, and his feud with Trump makes him safe to virtue signal about."
e4y0zc6;countjulian;1535440453.0;"Maddox is a huge cuck, so the  meaning is obvious. Maddox's only sexual contact while Gamms was in the room was with his own hand"

e4ytttp;apeshitdonkeydiq;1535481325.0;"Yeah that's the one. Mike Gamms was a guest on the biggest debate though."
e4yaxec;chronus_poo;1535450722.0;"Over 60% of Americans favored the invasion of Iraq leading up to the war. You can call McCain a piece of shit if you want, but you may as well call most of the country a piece of shit while you're at it."
e4zz44b;Sressolf;1535520925.0;"That sounds true. Remember on Biggest Problem when he'd brag about being so smart that he could see problems with the right **and** the left?"
e4yl30j;DickMasterson;1535463373.0;"Negative. "
e4ybpdo;PersonMcGuy;1535451523.0;"The populace wanting something against their best interests isn't justification for doing that thing when it's in direct response to the most horrific terrorist incident in the country's history. People are easily motivated by emotion and senators shouldn't be making decisions to go to war over an emotional desire for retaliation. Senators are meant to be more intelligent than the average citizen and make decisions based on what's best for the population not what feels good."

e4ytre4;JackMcOck;1535481195.0;"McCain was a piece of shit and so’s your face."
e4yevgj;ozzie_ozzie;1535455013.0;"Colin Powell saying Iraq had WMD's sealed the decision in our head for most of us at the time. Saddam was playing chicken also kicking out inspectors and what-not, so he looked guilty as sin."
e4yxkly;chronus_poo;1535487255.0;">  Senators are meant to be more intelligent than the average citizenSo he's a piece of shit for being dumb? That's a bit harsh."
e4yxzhe;chronus_poo;1535487788.0;"100% of Senators were told by the executive branch that Iraq had drones loaded with WMDs on ships off the East coast of the US."
e4zrr3y;PersonMcGuy;1535514657.0;"When you being dumb results in tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of deaths then yeah."
e4yybgg;Bottleroach;1535488201.0;"And?"
e4z7824;chronus_poo;1535497187.0;"I was originally comparing McCain to the American public in terms of foolishness. You said the American public was lied to. I'm saying that the Senate was as well."
e503fax;Bottleroach;1535524882.0;"Except McCain was like the War Parrot that kept squawking WAR WAR WAR WAR whenever possible. And it's not like 100% of Congress voted yes. McCain should've been a nay, you know, if he was truly a maverick and a warrior for peace or whatever nonsense label that's been attached to him."
e50c3x1;chronus_poo;1535533211.0;"You're right that he was way too hawkish. He also sang "bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran", bringing some levity to the idea of jumping into yet another quagmire in the Middle East."

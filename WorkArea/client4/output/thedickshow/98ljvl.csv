98ljvl;copperbonker;1534725760.0;"Well, should I? The problem is I don't know anyone who plays it."

e4gx7m1;Toon_Pagz;1534726645.0;"It's only fun kitchen table style with mates. Playing randos in stores is literal cancer."
e4gxd5k;revnja;1534726782.0;"If you don't know people to play with, you're probably gonna have a bad time."
e4gxg0i;Mr-Scurvy;1534726853.0;"Nope. I was into it for several years in middle school. You absolutely need a set of friends who are at least willing to play with you. I collected the cards for a couple of years before I ever even met someone else who played. Dick would not have gotten back into it if 80s girl didn't start playing with him. "
e4gwe0u;USDebtCrisis;1534725859.0;"no"
e4gzht7;TwevOWNED;1534728805.0;"No, mainly because Magic is a money pit and due to its nature will rarely result in players being on equal footing unless they each have expensive, top tier decks. In addition, unless you have a spare deck, it's not something you can easily bring other friends into. You could purchase one of the sets that contains two ready to play decks that are balanced against eachother, but if you wanted to go that route you should just buy a board game instead. I'd recommend  [Warhammer: Invasion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/47185/warhammer-invasion) as it has a gameplay style similar to Magic, but in a form that only needs to be purchased once, and can be played with friends who aren't interested in dumping money into a card game."
e4h3k05;datt_toke;1534732758.0;"Try the  "duels" series of Magic video games, pick the earliest year for the least complicated mechanics. They're great fun, and you don't have to mess around with real cards. It also does all the imagination part for you. However if you want to play against other humans, you'll have to play their most recent version. Otherwise the new Arena game is an option, but i'm not very interested it it. "
e4htj8a;cblasfemia;1534758973.0;"At my old job me and a few coworkers used to play Paupers Magic (you're only allowed to use common cards). We bought a stack of like 10,000 cards from some guy on ebay for $30 and then all made decks out of it and played against each other at lunch and it was pretty fun.If you can find people who want to do that, you can avoid the money sink and autist issues that other posters here are describing."
e4h2l2a;lucafox;1534731796.0;"Wizards of the Coast supports and protects pedophiles. "
e4gxyki;iamlovemonkey;1534727345.0;"I've played a couple times, wasn't for me. From what I've heard, it's a big money pit. I've got plenty of things I dump more money into than I want to think about. Have you thought of putting all that extra money into patreon.com/asterios?"
e4h4cgg;Cdglax2000316;1534733540.0;"Yes. just started playing a couple of years ago and it's addicting as fuck. the key is to have a buddy who already plays so you can learn shit"
e4hsx8q;huckbeine;1534758344.0;"Magic for me became so obtuse and shit after the 4th edition. and with banning of old stuff, its hard to play with a 4th ed deck anymore since no one has one"
e4htmpu;sweetb00bs;1534759066.0;"the title made me think you wanted to be a magician. A slight of hand guy. I was wrong. It was worse than I thought. "
e4i3vo2;PM_ME_COLDSNAP_CARDS;1534771613.0;"Yes. I am banned from the MTG Arena subreddit. We can be friends :)Edit: But no real joke if you want to know anything and everything about magic, ask me. I'll answer any questions."
e4iamzz;scarmask;1534784730.0;"Magic is an excellent game, but it is a money sink. That, and wizards of the coast is cancer, and has been terminal for the last few years, so I have trouble endorsing their products in good conscience.If you're keen I recommend playing casually with friends. Build friendly jank decks, or casual edh or something. Don't try to play a competitive format unless you wanna try pauper, or play with proxies.Edit: oh and don't bother with r/magictcg it's the biggest subbreddit but it is thoroughly infected. If you're the sort of person who can enjoy tds you'll get banned pretty quick. "
e4im96n;LtLongPhallus;1534802487.0;"No, you need friends to play magic. Also, Magic won't get rid of your scales."
e4gyu65;KansasCityChris;1534728184.0;"Absolutely not. Itâ€™s a money-sink, and you need a PhD in the game just to start to understand the game meta. Go find a living card game (LCG) if you want to get into deck building. I recommend Ashes or Netrunner. "
e4h85ow;Stiffalis420;1534737315.0;"I would suggest it if you're into that type of thing. I would suggest doing some drafts and shit like that before I would attempt spending money on building a deck."
e4he5r9;PROM0TED;1534743300.0;"Yeah. Try arena."
e4hq1r7;DKB827;1534755322.0;"see if you can find a free welcome deck from a local game store."
e4hua74;Pestosterone;1534759735.0;"Wait until Artifact comes out in November. It's designed by the guy who did Magic and developed by Valve, one of the biggest game companies in the world. Seems like it's going to be a base price of $30 with no more cost."
e4hxbkv;14_f_cali_pix;1534762911.0;"Card games are a money sink. If you have hundreds to thousands of dollars for a card game to play with a bunch of BO smelling neck beards, then sure go for it."
e4id6al;Ben2749;1534790147.0;"If you hate having money, absolutely."
e4ie81v;pacolingo;1534792134.0;"get the arena PC game to see if it's your jam, it's fun and free. pm me for a beta code.just stay the fuck off any magic related subreddit, they're the whiniest cesspools of pedantic fuckheads the internet has ever seen."
e4ihsec;Bananaheli;1534797405.0;"Magic the gathering arena is a great way to get in to magic. "
e4ik18q;Doc_StockandBarrel;1534800096.0;"See if a local gaming store runs any commander pods or events. Like Dick, I played many years ago and recently got back into it because of the [commander format](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/commander-format) : a fun, casual, multiplayer format. The format can very easily be enjoyed on a budget without being a timesink. It's an unofficial, fan-created format, but WotC makes pre-constructed decks for it. In fact, this years [crop of pre-cons](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/Commander-2018) just came out 2 weeks ago."
e4irzz3;jahvidsanders44;1534807845.0;"Magic? Nah.You definitely want to get into Warhammer 40k instead."
e4ivr7h;Workamania;1534811112.0;"Get the video game. That way you can actually play people and learn the rules."
e4h7ufr;Stiffalis420;1534737012.0;"Some of the best friends I've ever had I met in my LGS... However, I will say that when I've played in stuff in Seattle (I live in a small town) the people at those things have been the worse people I could ever imagine being around."
e4ivwvr;avnavar;1534811246.0;"Most are butthurt pricks who stopped showering when their moms stopped making them. Some are cool but the rest are awful.Fun fact: Last year I stopped by my LGS with my daughter to pawn off girl scout cookies to fatsos, and she vomited in the middle of the floor due to the extreme BO."
e4htk0k;sweetb00bs;1534758993.0;"lol"
e4iw4lm;jumbopanda;1534811428.0;"If you are a complete autism you could also just play the online version. There's something extra insulting about having to pay money for digital cards though.If you don't want to invest hundreds of dollars, you should just stick with drafts. You can also sell the valuable cards you obtain to get more boosters and enter more drafts, minimizing the amount of money you need to spend."
e4h81ax;Stiffalis420;1534737196.0;"I agree with most of this, but if you only draft or play standard, it's not too expensive IMO. Building a modern deck is fucking dumb."
e4iue1t;MazInger-Z;1534809929.0;"The economy's completely changed.  They intentionally make mechanically significant cards very rare now.  I spoke to a friend who still plays and the days of a strategic use of commons completely wrecking someone's day are long long gone.Probably since Time Spiral, where they neutered Planeswalkers and tried to turn Magic into a character-driven IP."
e4hkte4;PROM0TED;1534750008.0;"LackeyTCG is a free program that'll let you have all the cards. It's not very user friendly but it's free."
e4hhxit;anarchistbunny;1534747075.0;"They are a good introduction to the game, and a learning of mechanics and flow of the game.I've also been considering running some Dickhead magic on Tabletop simulator via the Dick Show Discord, if you're interested in that hit me up in there."
e4ie5ru;pacolingo;1534792019.0;"So do families, apparently. "
e4i8exx;Shinji_is_annoying;1534779805.0;"I thought Adam Warski "fixed" that problem"
e4idfpp;Ben2749;1534790665.0;"Not sure why you got downvoted; this is sound advice.Anybody interested in a card game should start by getting a pre-built theme deck. They're cheap, and contain a functional deck, which allows you to get a feel for the game."
e4j2ut4;avnavar;1534817128.0;"And unlike most WotC precons, they're actually serviceable."
e4jm8gq;Stiffalis420;1534833914.0;"There are around 4 weirdos who are always at my LGS who play Pokemon(I think) that the store owner asked to play at the lone table on the other side of the store because "they need the other tables for giving people space to make decks after drafts" but it was actually because of how bad those fucks smell."
e4jlzpp;Stiffalis420;1534833693.0;"Because people love to hate mtg these days."
e4jqohq;avnavar;1534845049.0;"It was yugioh. Only pedos and children play Pokemon. Extra smelly weirdos play the yugimans"

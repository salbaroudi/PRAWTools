99ct5i;gmkmc;1534968868.0;Since it's a big week talking about feeds
99ct5i;gmkmc;1534968868.0;"What is going on with the Dick Show Google play feed?? It's been late the last several weeks, and this week it hasn't been posted at all. "

e4mxx11;DickMasterson;1534981361.0;"Episodes get stuck in "Processing" forever. Every week they say it's a system-wide problem they've fixed. Every week they fuck it up!"
e4mpdbe;RobotOverlord328;1534973664.0;"Get a podcast app that isn't Google. The Google app sucks dick. "
e4mscp2;MaxMonkey;1534976536.0;"I've noticed that too. "
e4x1n13;drnc;1535408989.0;"This guy said he found a solution.  Worth a shot.https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/play/PX5Bpzjc1C0/g1lHJJV7CgAJ>UPDATE -  I found that blocking the episode, and then unblocking it, allowed it to populate on the public page. /shrugs/"
e4mrqfe;DixieChawDawg;1534975960.0;"The google app is awesome. Music and podcast on the same app, saves its place when you switch between devices. Easiest music/podcast app Ive ever used."
e4yl8nm;DickMasterson;1535463627.0;"Tried it. Let's see if it works."
e4q28k2;RobotOverlord328;1535095972.0;"Apparently not because you're not getting episodes. Podcast Addict auto downloads from the RSS feed, as soon as Libsyn updates I have the episode."
e4ny85n;ChaosCowboy;1535012055.0;"thanks, Sundar Pichai"
e4o8nru;BenadrylPeppers;1535022629.0;"Have you even tried other apps like Pocket Casts? GPM sucks and I'm a subscriber to it. "
e4yvtyl;drnc;1535484814.0;"I still don't see it, but episode 117 is up. Thanks Dick. "
e4q2ufk;DixieChawDawg;1535096601.0;"I watch the episodes on Patreon because I'm not some poor peasant like you.  My other podcasts don't have this issue.  I'm good."
e4o3fw0;DixieChawDawg;1535017087.0;"Damn, didn't realize me liking an app would be so hated.  Tough crowd."
e4oamj4;DixieChawDawg;1535024850.0;"I do have other podcast apps for podcasts that aren't on GPM.  That being said, TDS is the only podcast I follow that has any issues being late (probably because it is smaller compared to what I subscribe to).  If I have nothing to do on Tuesday I usually like to play the video version of TDS because I am a Patreoni, so it's not really an issue.GPM is nice because it gives you all the music streaming plus Youtube Red which allows me to listen to Youtube only podcast without having to keep my phone unlocked."
e4qlcz5;RobotOverlord328;1535117433.0;"You seem like a real level headed and interesting person. I wish we could hang out more."
e4o3ixt;ChaosCowboy;1535017172.0;"You woke the wrong dong"
e4rj7sl;DixieChawDawg;1535160765.0;"Thanks man, me too."
e4o4h7k;DixieChawDawg;1535018120.0;"Haha, I guess so. I've learned my lesson"
e4o52p3;ChaosCowboy;1535018720.0;"Yeah don't come around here no more with your helpful suggestions and shit"
e4oag68;DixieChawDawg;1535024644.0;"Sir yes sir"

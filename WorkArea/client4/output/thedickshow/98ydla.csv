e4jo3jd;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534837296.0;"Yea, no shit. Apple is like...one of the easiest targets. And if I remember, that Maddox motherfucker didn't even talk about the Chinese labor camps that they abuse, having to install nets on top of their buildings to save employees that they drive to suicide.Apple is just a logo that they stamp on shiny things for the gullible and people with just an extra thousand dollars they can drop down on something so everyone will look at them for a second.Pretty good for editing though, I could just build a machine at half the price."

e4jogkm;Ashanmaril;1534838257.0;"> Apple is just a logo that they stamp on shiny things for the gullible and people with just an extra thousand dollars they can drop down on something so everyone will look at them for a second.Or maybe people just like the stuff they make. You're lying to yourself if you think you get the same experience on every other computer product."
e4kfulh;Icon_Crash;1534884156.0;"> having to install nets on top of their buildings to save employees that they drive to suicideWell that's a bit of creative fiction.  Suicide clusters are a real and known thing.  It's not something confined to Chinese factories.  In addition, the suicide rate at Foxconn is lower than the populace at large.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/09/20/the-guardian-wrong-apple-suicide-china-wages-about-everything-all-the-time/#455f1f982e93Granted, it's not a great situation working there if you compare it to labor conditions here in the States or in Canada, but for the most part it's a far better life than most of the people working there had before they got the job.  "
e4o1nxi;SuburbanYute;1535015346.0;"Definitely. His reasoning for hating apple was the same as expensive steak and wine. "
e4jp7ng;SuburbanYute;1534840286.0;"Yes. Paying for music that will only work on Apple products is a great user experience. Losing actual money in order to change to a different ecosystem is a goddamned luxurious experience worth several thousand dollars. "
e4kkdmm;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534889021.0;"Yea, the mouse is all one button and if you want to right click, you have to hold a key down. What is this? Shitty Linux? It's a different experience like Disneyland is to Six Flags. It's the same fucking shit but you pay a lot more for one of them and they convince you it's better because they're so strict their employees have communal underwear."
e4k40ra;PersonMcGuy;1534862066.0;">Or maybe people just like the stuff they make.Some people like eating shit, doesn't mean it's not shit they're eating.>You're lying to yourself if you think you get the same experience on every other computer product.Yep, you can get the positive aspects of the apple experience without all the DRM and bullshit annoyances. "
e4jp9ow;Ashanmaril;1534840437.0;"Yeah nobody else locks you into their ecosystem"
e4jup86;SithisTheDreadFather;1534849820.0;"Imagine still being butthurt about DRM from literally a decade ago."
e4kknos;Ashanmaril;1534889293.0;"So you're a big fan of Windows?"
e4kesi8;Ashanmaril;1534882406.0;"Alright you go build your Linux phone from mud and twigs but most people don't care"
e4jphov;SuburbanYute;1534841017.0;"Yeah, at this point it's a pretty stupid debate. Google and Microsoft both fuck you pretty hard too. But at least you're not paying as much for the privilege of being fucked.If someone would hurry up and make a decent Linux phone people could choose not to get fucked."
e4kk04p;IDontRememberMyOldAC;1534888656.0;"I'm butthurt about DRM fucking now with my video games. Get raped."
e4jpjoo;Ashanmaril;1534841156.0;"Google Pixel they priced the exact same as the iPhone. And Microsoft doesn't even make phones unless you count Nokia"
e4jq0od;SuburbanYute;1534842476.0;"That's only phones though. You pay far more money for Apple laptops, tablets, and desktops. "
e4jwrjv;CivicPlaza;1534851996.0;"All the good PC laptops I've looked at are expensive though. The HP Spectre, a clear Macbook competitor, is 1.3k. All the other solid HP builds that aren't folding pieces of touchscreen garbage are 900 and above. Most don't even seem to have solid state drives. The macbook Air, which has all the neccesary ports and things, runs great and starts at $1000 right now. I got a i7 Air a while ago for 1000 and change, and it runs great.Ever consider people want the Operating System? For the average user I'd say iOS and OSX are way more friendly than Windows or Linux or Android. I'm not even a big Apple guy but I definitely prefer OSX to Windows, which I use at work. Also all tech is made in Asia, mostly china, with Intel processors being the only thing I know of that's made in the USA. "
e4jxijs;SuburbanYute;1534852843.0;"I've run Linux exclusively for the last 3 years and had less problems than i ever did with windows. and my computer lasts a lot longer than when i was a mac user. "
e4k2np5;Stiffalis420;1534859804.0;"All higher end laptops seems ridiculous to me... for $1,000 you could build a decent gaming computer... Then again, I've never been in a situation where I need to be using laptops."
e4jxl6v;CivicPlaza;1534852929.0;" agree with that 100%, Id like to become technical enough to run Linux. Ill take either Linux or Mac everyday over Windows though."
e4k337b;CivicPlaza;1534860490.0;"Portability is nice, I like getting shit done on the go or in nice places and dont game enough to need a high end pc. Depends on your life style though. I definitely see the appeal of the built pc."

e4l2zdd;Cathinswi;1534904820.0;"It seems like Maddox is really saying Dick isn't a "real mexican" because he doesn't act like a cholo or didn't climb the fence. It's like saying a black guy isn't really black because he has a dad. This fucking loser shows his real colors in DMs."

e4l88vl;backwards7ven;1534909246.0;"There was a film franchise in Britain called the Carry On movies that traded in saucy innuendo and seaside postcard humour in the years before you could say 'fuck' on television. They were popular during the 1960s and 70s. They were themed around a period in history like the Wild West, or a setting such as a hospital, and they had a recurring ensemble cast. One of the actors, Sid James, had a laugh so dirty that it could strip away female underwear at 20 yards.Dame Pesos is the Mexican Sid James. It kills me that he purchased the mundanemattisafatfaggot domain with a coupon."

e4klnit;MomentOfXen;1534890233.0;"Ooooo those women garbage sales. That strikes a chord.Everyone should constantly rip on those ItWorks Herbalife nonsense that people try and peddle of Facebook. Not only are the products ripoffs but whatever voodoo training they put their people through turns them into cultists. The change in personality is downright scary. Why you would ever voluntarily add another middle-man onto the chain of commerce you are already subject to is beyond me. Go to the store, order some shit online, everything is available for you to be cutting out middle-men and get better goods for less, don't go backwards you fucks. "
e4m2any;Ashanmaril;1534937543.0;"Dick, that watermelon voicemail guy wasn't talking about eating the entire rind, he's just talking about the shitty white part near the bottom that's hard and tastes like nothing. So you stop eating before you get there but then you're constantly being judged by the people who are so proud of themselves for munching all the way through the bland shit."
e4nr16f;jahvidsanders44;1535005352.0;"Why the fuck does Maddox keep having these chats with people when every single time it ends up screenshotted and posted here? Is he just falling into that "maybe it won't happen this time" trap? Is he secretly hoping these conversations get leaked because he's too chickenshit to tell Dick to his face? Is he actually having way more of these conversations that don't get leaked and we're only seeing like 1% of the potential Goss that's out there?I sure hope so."

I've personally seen it a few times, they trick desperate women into thinking they "own a small business" and they go to these weird cult conventions where they find out which new products they're selling. I don't know how you convince someone that that's how a normal small business works, but they sure do it. And they make it their entire personality and lives, they sink all their money into it, so if you even so much as suggest that they're involved in a scam and you don't want to be involved, it's a personal attack on them. It's crazy how they've just exploited this weird flaw in the human brain."

I previously only played the SNES ones so I just started at X4 and have been working my way through. X4 I really liked, X5 was alright but Alia interrupting with unskippable dialogue to say completely obvious things was annoying, X6 was a trainwreck (which makes sense considering it was rushed out in a year), and X7 has been unplayable trash so far.I just wanted to throw that out cause you mentioned Mega Man X."

e4l2bpa;The_Atticus;1534904275.0;"Ibuprofen is the preferred painkiller for hangovers. Tylenol is the one that risks liver damage if there's any leftover alcohol. Ibuprofen after drinking won't really do much except maybe exacerbate stomach lining irritation if drinking already created it. The reverse isn't as good, though. Taking ibuprofen weakens your stomach's ability to not digest itself, so drinking alcohol soon after it can cause stomach pain in the short term, and lead to damage to your stomach or intestines in the long term. The effects are less bad with more dilute drinks though (e.g. beer as opposed to whiskey) because there's more of a buffer.Tl;dr never have both tylenol and alcohol in your system at the same time. Try to only take ibuprofen for a hangover and not while drinking. "

e4ljg4r;The_Atticus;1534918827.0;"Tylenol on it's own is a lot safer than Ibuprofen or other painkillers when the dosage is followed. As long as you stay within dosage limits, it doesn't do you any harm at all. Compare that to NSAIDs, whose mechanism of action will always have the side effect of weakening your stomach's ability to protect itself from its digestion. I don't know if you've ever taken Aleve or a large Ibuprofen dose on an empty stomach but it's definitely unpleasant for a lot of people. Tylenol doesn't have that problem.But seriously, don't overdose on tylenol or you'll seriously fuck up your liver."

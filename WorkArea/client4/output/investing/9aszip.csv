9aszip;cbgdl;1535434175.0;"The original article is [here](https://medium.com/@quantvc/power-laws-in-venture-capital-why-the-long-tail-matters-22e057c6fa34). My best summary:Venture capital returns are highly skewed and probably best characterized by power law distributions (the 80/20 rule), where a few startups generate most of the economic returns. > if you apply the 80–20 rule to the top 20% of venture capital deals, then 4% of the deals produce 64% of all returns. Apply the 80–20 rule again to the top 4% of deals and you get 0.8% of deals producing 51.2% of all returns. The implication is that 1 in 20 deals may produce 2/3 of all returns and 1 in 100 deals may return more than all other deals combined.This implies that VCs should "only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund" and ignore the rest. However, unicorns are rare even among top portfolios and are very hard to predict in the early stage. The average growth rate of all small businesses in the US is closer to 7.5% than 30%.On the contrary, it is possible to generate high returns from startups outside the top 20%. Example: Union Square Ventures, which focuses on the “long tail of investments that don’t move the needle for the VC fund.”. The fat tail of the power law curve is systematically under-invested in and represents a treasure trove of opportunities.> The power law curve reflects the idea that “we want everyone to become a hyper-performer” if they can find the right fit, and that we don’t limit people at the top of the curve -- we try to create more of them.Humanity could be a competitive advantage in the cut-throat tech startup / VC world."

9azoot;IndianaGeoff;1535497567.0;"Question... what happens if Tesla fails to deliver a significant quantity of $35,000 cars.  With normal material inflation, every month it fails to do so, it gets harder and harder.  What would be the impact of failing to hit that promise?"

e4za4zu;AccountsArePointless;1535499756.0;"We'll find out at the end of this quarter hahaha"
e4z815b;calculman3829;1535497907.0;"Bankruptcy.They're already failing to deliver 35k cars. They're not making them and there's a lot of evidence for lack of demand for the more expensive tiers."
e4z8vtk;r3dl3g;1535498659.0;">What would be the impact of failing to hit that promise?The same thing that happens if any company isn't able to turn a profit; bankruptcy.We'll know by...what, March? When the next round of SolarCity debt comes due? Point being, Tesla needs to come up with ~$800 million in cash to pay down their debt, *or* raise the stock price above $360ish in order to trigger the convertibility on the bonds."
e4zmgvs;dvdmovie1;1535510219.0;"In related news, Elon arguing/having a tantrum on Twitter again. "
e4zy073;ObservationalHumor;1535519962.0;"At a minimum probably a credit rating downgrade and a refund of deposits.  Beyond that it depends on a lot of things.  How much ZEV credits sell for, what Tesla's deposit backlog looks like in terms of trims, getting EU approval w/o major re-engineering of the interior and where the stock actually sits when it comes to refinancing their convertible bonds.I don't think bankruptcy is as close as a lot of people make it out to be but if cash flow doesn't materialize in Q3 they're likely to file to raise equity in Q4.  The biggest threat is the stock collapsing for some reason prior to that for some reason."
e4zpbpq;teknic111;1535512616.0;"Did Tesla arrive at $35k by accounting for tax incentives and gas savings or is the car really going to MSRP for $35k??"
e4z8qcb;NoReallyFuckReddit;1535498526.0;"> what happens if Tesla fails to deliver a significant quantity of $35,000 cars.Well, the way the delivery queue is currently structured, they lose a bunch of customers who were going to purchase cars at a price that don't make Tesla any money.  Washing out all the dumb fucks standing around waiting for their $35k Tesla is inevitable anyway because the government subsidy starts drying up in six months."
e4zmw2f;DJIisStupid;1535510572.0;"Most firms you'd expect them to lower guidance, perhaps change strategy, etc. With tesla you'd also expect them to raise capital again to get through upcoming debt convertibles. But also with Tesla you get Musk so idk at this point."
e5002c5;AresStare;1535521766.0;"I won't speak to what I think will happen, but I know three people that did pre-orders.  One walked away with a $60k Model 3, the second asked for their refund back because they refused to pay more than $35k to get the options they wanted, and the third is undecided.  If 1/3 of pre-orders ask for their money back TSLA will have some cashflow issues."
e5004g4;G_Morgan;1535521818.0;"Based upon current figures failing to deliver enough cars will actually improve their bottom line. They seem to be losing money on every car produced right now. They are doing so many odd things to massage the production figures up with emergency measures that they might well be screwed either way."
e4z9f2b;dominodanger;1535499127.0;">"With normal material inflation"Are you talking about the 2-3% typical consumer price index inflation rate? 2 or 3% on an annual basis is not going to significantly affect them between now and when they do start shipping $35k cars. 2% annually is equivalent to about 0.17% per month, or about $60 inflation on $35k, per month. Which is pretty insignificant. If they up and decided to charge $35,700 (or 2% more) for the base price instead of $35,000, most would likely not even find the change to be worth commenting on."
e502xen;WizOnTheFence;1535524418.0;"Once you own a Tesla, you may feel different. It has its issues. It’s not perfect. It’s not cheap. But Tesla is so much more than a car company. These guys are in Apple when they fired Steve Jobs territory. What they do in the next 2 years will make or break them. I am personally all in. I think the Model 3 is their iMac. It’s putting them on the path to something more. I haven’t seen their iPhone yet (my guess is a pick up truck) but I look forward to it daily. I’m here for the long haul and have been since 2016. I don’t plan to sell...ever. I’d also love to see Tesla go private again, but that’s selfish motivation because I have better returns with private companies.If you are playing the short game and trying to cash out in < 5 years, this is not the stock for you.

e4zaz5i;Maxxenter;1535500473.0;"It doesn't matter what they do. At some point Tesla will go bankrupt, bought out by another car company and Musk will be investigated for securities fraud and get a slap on the wrist. &#x200B;Most obvious thing I have ever seen in markets. The timeline is the problem though so it is not really that tradeable and LEAPS puts are already pricey. "
e4zmjtz;miscsubs;1535510286.0;"Maybe they'll stop trying to make a low-margin car that is hard to produce (evidently) and concentrate on what they do best: High margin electric luxury and sports cars.They might even see if they can expand the business to other profitable products like trucks and what not. But someone needs to tell Elon his "master plan" was a bad idea that set the company back half a decade, so there's that."
e4z94ps;userandaloser;1535498877.0;"Even if they do hit their production targets, some analysts have claimed the car isn't as profitable as the company needs it to be to stay afloat. It's not just a matter of hitting those targets, but at what cost."

e4zyfoe;HOG_ZADDY;1535520325.0;"I'll go down on this ship, but I don't trust the production numbers Tesla is putting out. No company struggles with production for a year and then suddenly doubles it overnight (without launching new factories, opening new production lines, etc)."

They're going to have to raise equity even if it does materialize on account of all that debt due 2020."
e500yc0;dragontamer5788;1535522562.0;"I'll be surprised if Tesla goes bankrupt before 2020.They have a decent amount of cash, and bonds can be reissued. Albeit at a higher interest rate, but Teslas bonds don't look like a death-spiral yet.They have a decent runway still. But it definitely doesn't look pretty, Tesla really needs to start getting positive cash flow soon.The main problem is if a recession hits and credit / equity markets dry up. For now, low-interest rates and cheap money means that a lot of investors are willing to throw their money at Tesla. As long as that's true, Tesla has a degree of runway still available."
e4zt79b;yumble95;1535515873.0;"Base 35k but with some reasonable options you end up a lot higher. Edit: So I just checked tesla.com and it isn't 35k at all. Not even with the 11+k they deduct as "cost savings".  Msrp is actually 49k by the looks of it.Edit edit:so 49k is the long range model, but I'm missing the short range 35k option."
e500ryd;G_Morgan;1535522403.0;"They've been downgraded and their share price has dropped. There is no cheap way for them to raise capital again."
e4zbx1j;IndianaGeoff;1535501287.0;"As pointed out above, the new base price is $49,000.  That is above the 2 to 3%."
e4zeew8;asssuber;1535503397.0;"The price was never raised to $49,000. That has been the price of the long range battery model since it's price was first announced.> Standard Battery available in 5-8 months That one is supposed to be the $35,000 one.

Whether or not they actually go to market to raise cash who knows. Also the looming thing with Tesla I think is the fact that the 7500 federal tax credit should be gradually rolling off. Granted there are state/local rebates too, but 7500 is a lot, and other EV makers will have access to the full 7500 tax credit as they (hopefully) begin rolling out their more competitive/better vehicles"
e4zbqha;IndianaGeoff;1535501130.0;"Yes for new deposits.  But thousands of deposits were taken at the $35k promise.  If Tesla doesn't deliver, you can expect states AG's to jump on this.  Maybe 10 states with existing car plants join in as a group and sue for fraud.  Just one scenario.And if they do produce and lose money on them..."

e50bio8;creepy_doll;1535532645.0;"as far as I understand: they shredded their long-term scaling ramp-up by aborting a lot of their fancy automated stuff by moving what they could under the "tent" and  relying on manual processes for a lot.Basically trading in the long term higher numbers  for the short term numbers."
e4z97fg;calculman3829;1535498942.0;"You can wait for Elon to tell you, or you can look at the parking lots and other images which are already telling.If they were still production limited, those employees would be working 26 hours a day (not even just 24).

e4zdx7a;calculman3829;1535502986.0;"There's clear indications that Tesla is doing things that would hurt them meeting that demand. It just doesn't make sense. Why would they ramp down the production at this critical stage?They're short on cash. More manufacturing means more cash outlays."
e4zl0e8;Working_onit;1535508992.0;"How sustainable is that demand at it's current price point.  Sure there's a lot of fanatics with money that will do whatever it takes to own that car, but what happens after they buy the car?"
e504wi0;swniko;1535526239.0;"Why do Tesla fans pay so much attention to US market? 1. Tesla is the only mass production electric vehicle on the market and thus only 3 Tesla cars compete with 100+ of internal combustion engine cars. I.e. the competition between internal combustion engine cars is much stronger than between 3 Tesla cars and Chevrolet Bolt. 2. Tesla is produced in the US for US market. I doubt that Mercedes or BMW pay big attention to the fact that their cars are popular in... Germany. "

e4z924g;userandaloser;1535498813.0;"Elon Musk has compared Model 3 production to betting the farm. The evidence is the strategy the company has laid out for itself."
e4z9h7b;pdx_rob;1535499179.0;"I don't fully agree with OP but the fact that the wait times are fairly short for new purchases suggests that the 4XXk reservation holders aren't converting to these configurations (or perhaps that the queue is more international than expected).

e50de63;ObservationalHumor;1535534428.0;"I don't disagree.  Most people feel that they should have already done so when the equity price was higher.  A big part of the speculation around there being a Wells Notice before Q2 earnings was the fact that they hadn't done so already.  Elon is dead set on not raising equity for whatever reason though.  If this company does end up hitting some kind of cash crisis before 2020 it's going to be because he was too damn stubborn to do an equity issuance earlier."
e503gqv;ObservationalHumor;1535524919.0;"I'm not sure how much debt they would be able to float if the share price dropped significant or at what terms.  7.75% on their 2025 and the prospect of rates being another 50+ bps higher before another raise doesn't put them in a very good spot.  The fact of the matter is this company still flat out isn't making positive cash flows or earnings and their assets aren't that easy to turn around.  They're already using the Fremont plant as collateral and borrowing against inventory.Moody's knocked them down again after the whole privatization debacle and a failure of cash flow or volume to materialize by EOY could easily lead to another notch down putting them in a terrible position to roll their 2019 debt.  They could still avoid bankruptcy but the terms they would have to do it on would be terrible.  The possibility of convertibility on the holders terms and a 7.5%+ rate of interest comes into play and it just gets worse from there for a company that's already struggling to manage any kind of cash flow.  People are still willing to pay a good chunk for equity but the bond markets haven't been nearly as favorable.  Tesla also doesn't really have any non-core assets it can shed to raise money either beyond ZEV credits.  I think the final stop gap might be licensing out their battery formulation/fabrication in some fashion but beyond that what is there really?  Maybe whatever interest they have in the Buffalo plant if Panasonic wants it and they can get out of their obligations to the government and that's a pretty big if.An equity raise seems like the best path forward and frankly should have happened previously when the stock was closer to $350.  Elon's been dead set on avoiding one though which has left the company in an unnecessarily fragile state."
e505k79;TeddysBigStick;1535526862.0;"> They have a decent amount of cashThe problem is that they are in an industry that requires an absurd amount of cash to operate.  GM had a lot of money in the bank when they filed but still had to do it because they needed the controls of the courts to keep functioning.  "
e4zv36e;compounding;1535517462.0;"Technically that’s for the “long range” version since they aren’t offering the “standard range” battery yet.But even still its really difficult to imagine how they could get down to that cost for the standard range version at a 30% reduction in price.  Even if the raw battery capacity costs upwards of 30% of the sales price (about the last reported costs for the 75 kWh battery at $190/kwh) and if they have phenomenal 20% gross margins on the long range base model, they would have to be selling the “standard range” version basically at-cost (actually gross margin of 1.4%) to get it down to $35k without other significant cost cutting..."

e4zqz18;mp54;1535513998.0;"They made money for one quarter maybe a year or so ago. That was the one right before production of the model 3 where Musk sent out the email to the Company to force profitability for one quarter."

e4zfy1j;dreamingofaustralia;1535504679.0;"I'm not sure where you are getting these ideas from. Tesla clearly has issues right now, but they don't include any of what you have stated.Their priority right now is ramping up production while increasing profitability to achieve free cash flow + by end of Q3. TSLA must show profitability in Q3/Q4 to increase valuation, stem losses, and allow the $360 convertible bonds to be converted to equity. If they can achieve these things, they are no longer in dire straits and Elon can sleep a lot better at night.Demand? They haven't even started selling the vehicle outside North America yet! Demand for any level of M3 will not be an issue for at least 12-18 months. There are tens/hundreds of thousands to sell in Europe, Australia, and Asia.When these thresholds are met, perhaps they will even start traditional advertisements for the first time ever. Lots of levers they could pull to stimulate demand when necessary, but clearly, that is not the case yet. The day you see a Tesla TV ad is when you can tell me organic demand has waned."

e504p94;dragontamer5788;1535526051.0;"Yeah, but 7.75% isn't really that bad, all else considered.If TSLA bonds rose to 8% or 9% even in the extreme case, it looks bad for the company. But in the great scheme of things, that's the cost of debt that Paypal or other companies in the 90s had to deal with.Yeah, its practically "nearly default" level on today's 2018 bond market, but that kind of yield was practically standard a couple of decades ago.If the general US Market has a recession however, all that money dries up. At which point, TSLA probably goes bankrupt. But for the near term (assuming no recession or whatnot), it seems likely that Tesla will secure funding.Even at a shitty rate like 8.5%+."

To go to the outside they have to spend a bunch of money on testing. Very expensive.You keep pushing this "Look at what they will be if they can do X".

It is a lot of money to spend on markets that have historically been extremely hostile to US cars. Tesla isn't that big a deal outside the US, every manufacturer in the world outside the US is at a similarly advanced stage for EVs.Tesla's only real play was to corner the US market via regulatory capture and they need to be basically functional before that will be allowed.

e4zgjep;dreamingofaustralia;1535505207.0;"The source is from TSLA's most recent quarterly report. You can calculate from their revenue and units sold that their ASP has increased for the M3. I don't have to read a fan blog to understand that. Every car manufacturer also announces their units sold at the beginning of each month. Lots of data points to go off of, no need to speculate. This isn't shocking as typically a newer product in most industries will have a higher selling  price at the beginning (e.g. iPhone sales cycle peaks during first 3 months with higher ASP's.)This quarter will probably have the highest M3 ASP and then it will slowly decrease from there, with unit volume increasing accordingly. Wealthier people will buy whatever is available, even if it is more expensive, and that evaporates over time as availability increases. "
e4zg9tp;calculman3829;1535504968.0;"Exactly. "
e50b674;ObservationalHumor;1535532314.0;"Well I mean frame of reference matters too we aren't exactly fighting off stagflation anymore and even in the 1990s underlying growth was a good clip higher.  I think that's besides the point though the main thing here is profitability and the actual cash flow burden of interest payments.  Tesla's debt is currently very cheap for them to service and if rates go up that high they'll literally have an extra billion+ in debt service without any earnings to back it up.  There's companies that can pull it off for sure, but Tesla is not a lean software startup (despite how they try to portray themselves sometimes) or some super stable infrastructure company.  The amount of margin expansion they would need to just to meet interest payments is greater than what most automakers pull in operating margins period.Granted that's better thank bankruptcy but at that point I think it's basically a zombie company anyways.  It might not declare bankruptcy for another year or two but it's prospects of ever becoming a large successful company would basically be dead."

e4zigim;rayfound;1535506851.0;">how can they "Ramp Up" with less people?I don't mean to weigh in on the specifics of Tesla... but in general with manufacturing my experience has been that during the push to increase rate the labor-hours (cars in the lot) spikes, then settles back down once a somewhat steady state is achieved, processes implemented, shift handoffs gets figured out, etc... "
e4zhq2h;dreamingofaustralia;1535506230.0;"So put your money where your mouth is and short the stock "short term" then. Using your words, you would short the stock to 0 within the next month? I don't see anything as guaranteed either way at this point. In fact, I'd say it's 50/50. A ramp doesn't end immediately after hitting 5k cars for one week. If you've ever worked in manufacturing, you'd know that they are still in the process of ramping. This process involves lots of iteration and tweaking, and also strives to lower the amount of human input. In addition, your statement about less people in the factory is factually inaccurate as they are still hiring hundreds of people per week according to local hiring firms. Ideally, it should involve less human hours per car built over time, though. Not more. Less people would be a positive sign for cost purposes.I've learned over time that anyone who states with absolute certainty that a stock will or will not hit a certain price is just making things up. If you knew these things, you'd be the richest person in the world. No one knows for sure. You state that North America is their biggest market, which is technically true, but not by much. 2017 north america revenues were only slightly above 50%. China, Norway, and others combine to almost equal the North American markets. Again, there is huge demand out there. Check your emotions and analyse logically. The lines to check out the model 3 in sydney/melbourne last week were around the block.I'm not talking about 6 or 12 months from now - i'm discussing Q3/Q4 which we are currently in/about to end. I am speaking of the present. "
e50b1y1;dreamingofaustralia;1535532202.0;"If their 2017 ex-USA revenue was ~40%, that potential revenue cannot be dismissed for the model 3. Their revenue shows they've had success in other countries regardless of regulatory requirements and selling in those countries can only be positive for demand. Your argument is like saying Starbucks or KFC shouldn't have launched lines in China. Of course there were major obstacles and regulatory issues, but the end result was worth it.  "

Doesn't mean my analysis isn't correct.You're saying that this drop in people at the factory is somehow normal. Given where Tesla should be it isn't. The parking lot with employees and the units should be packed. But this is only a small part of the story.Are you talking about EV as a market? I have a hard time seeing China buying 49k+ EVs when Lucid or others will have an easier time in China. Tesla cannot ramp up further, as Elon and others confirmed, without a Factory in China. Where are they getting that money? you think China will give it? They may, if only to steal all the tech later.Q3 may be ok but Tesla is running out of money. Q4/Q1 are definitively at risk. They have to have a cash infusion or game over."

But emotionally(which is why I absolutely believe I shouldn't invest in them since I can't be rational about it) I really hope they succeed because I like the concept, and I think they deserve to reap the harvest they sowed(by coming out and showing the world that you can make a 100% electric car that doesn't suck).

e4zq0an;igotopinionsppl;1535513191.0;"Ok let’s look at facts:Tesla said it will produce 50-55k T3 in Q3 during last earnings call. Recent reports said they will produce less than that. Producing that many cars does not mean delivering that many cars as seen in previous earnings call. So, please explain, how exactly are T3s “selling like hot cakes.”Let me give you another fact: Tesla is losing money and still has not been able to make a 35k car. "

e4zqp3w;dreamingofaustralia;1535513769.0;"1) You’re conflating an official earnings report with unsubstantiated 3rd party analysis. Bloomberg tracker says they will exceed that goal, while elektrek inside info says they will fall short. Where will the truth be? We will find out soon - more official production data coming in a week. 2) I’m arguing that neither you nor the bulls know if Tesla will be profitable in q3/q4. You seem to state with certainty that this will not happen. I say it’s possible it can go either way. Tesla has been bleeding cash. Do believe that is continuing this quarter or is slowing down? Or has it reversed and turned to minor gains?3) Making a 35k car is not important to their survival right now. They are selling as many cars as they can make (supply constrained.) They need to become profitable now, boost the share price above 360 on improved sentiment, convert the bonds to equity, and then focus on making 35k cars early next year. Will they be able to do this? Jury is out - but it’s not an easy bet to make either way. "

It’s safe to assume that anything from Electrek has been proofread by Tesla. If they’re saying production will fall short, brace for even worse. 2. Given their guidance on profitability next quarter, a calculated guess will be that they will be not. 3. They’re selling that many cars because there is a huge backlog. How many of the backlog orders have been fulfilled? How many new orders Tesla is getting every week/month? How many of the orders have been cancelled? Anyone that’s extremely bullish on the company ought to have these numbers. "

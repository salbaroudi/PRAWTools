e4u5mkn;bricengreen;1535271555.0;"I think smoking will be the smallest percentage of how cannabis will be consumed. Edibles, vapes, patches, drinks, etc."
e4rro99;erniefu;1535167967.0;"That ship has sailed. Any vice company has had plans for the legalization of weed in Canada since it was announced last year. Trying to cash in now is like Mattel buying the learning company from Kevin O'Leary."

e4rqi1s;cognitive-dissonance;1535166947.0;"I don't think big tobacco companies would need to acquire smaller weed companies. Weed grows like a weed. The distribution and marketing infrastructure already exists for big tobacco. If it is legalized, they will be able to start crushing the competition from day one."
e4royko;Walden_Walkabout;1535165614.0;"They probably have already started on their own programs."
e4s321n;thethiefstheme;1535178404.0;"The argument for this is a few months ago, Jakob ripstein, former CEO of Diageo Canada joined aphria. Also aphria has deals with Southern Glazer, the official alcohol distributor for Diageo in North America.Both companies are very close in terms of relationships, and given aphria is building an extraction center, and is trading at a  reasonable 50-60 PE, maybe a cash infusion of a free hundred million for aphria for 10-20% of the company might be a strong possibility.

e4rtbbx;Spiritual_Dragonfly;1535169388.0;"The hardest part is finding a workforce with experience in the space. Right now the only people with experience are already working for these companies. So instead of having to spend the money recruiting an entire new division of your company from C-suite down, they could just buy a cannabis company to get the ball rolling"
e4rtz70;Willsturd;1535169962.0;"Developing in house vs acquisition is the challenge all corporations have.I believe for super majors, it makes more sense to acquire. The time and energy can be insane in just the recruiting process alone. With an acquisition, they just need to spend cash which they should have tons of. Just my opinion."
e4rywqa;A_Drunken_Koala;1535174389.0;"I assume they have it all ready. Marketing, packaging, space for the grow. They're not dumb. The writing is on the wall, it's only a matter of time before it's a market they can enter"
e4s5txi;ExtendedDeadline;1535181214.0;"Maybe revise those numbers and we can talk?"
e4skpog;All-sTATE-insurance;1535197507.0;"Tilray, Cronos and Aphria are the three most likely in no particular order."
e4s6sip;daaave33;1535182212.0;"Insulation via diversity, dividends, ownership track record, low price per share based upon potential (which weed stocks certainly lack), and the market cap to eat the target up. Not sure what you're missing. I own Aphria/Canopy/others too, but I like value. Ridiculous to ignore it. "
e4sasm1;I_like_back_massage;1535186408.0;"What difference does it make if it’s big tobacco, big alcohol or big weed?"
e4s3h4c;lastgreenleaf;1535178822.0;"You can that now, but once they have Justin Bieber doing ads, and are conveniently stocked in every store possible, you might change you mind. "
e4txtkl;blkblade;1535263137.0;"Exactly. Canada is just the starting point. The entire sector will grow orders of magnitude over the course of the world legalizing it. Could be 5, 10 or maybe even 20 years from now, but the MJ sector is only set to grow heavily."
e4sgtc4;aruss88;1535192943.0;"It is for them"
e4rxfz5;deadlock91;1535173062.0;"I mean spending billions on acquisitions is expensive too if all you need is some workforce you could go and poach some employees from current companies just keep throwing money at them and it'll still be way cheaper  . Offer a few guys 5x what they currently making with couple of million  boom done without spending billions "
e4ru3c4;cognitive-dissonance;1535170064.0;"> The hardest part is finding a workforce with experience in the space. I am not a weed expert, but what makes weed harder to grow than tabacco?  It appears to me that farming is farming, whether you are growing tobacco or pot.  I am sure that big tobacco has an army of very smart and well trained botanists and PhDs that can figure it out. "

e4t5dxg;Mr-_-Positivity;1535234271.0;"Phillip Morris currently manufactures and distributes a product that they know will cause COPD and reduce your life expectancy. And no, marijuana does not cause COPD and is no where near the risk for lung cancer. I don’t trust Phillip Morris. "
e4sdrec;CarRamRob;1535189588.0;"Because your not fighting the man.  "
e4s5vn4;Skeptophile;1535181262.0;"Ads sure as hell won't be legal in Canada, same as tobacco."
e4rxm9f;Spiritual_Dragonfly;1535173218.0;"Well yes but the billions in acquisitions gives you an entire workforce but also an entire company. Ideally one with many problems already solved. For tobacco companies it really could go either way. Start their own operation or buy one. Neither would be cheap but an acquisition would likely be quicker even if it was more expensive."
e4s291a;TrollBearPig-what;1535177601.0;"They also need licenses to grow it which can take years to get. It's going to be a highly regulated industry. Takes 1-2 years to stablize strain genetics to grow in mass. Will need to retrofit greenhouses which takes about a year. Plus the trained workforce as you said"
e4ruguo;Spiritual_Dragonfly;1535170395.0;"While there are plenty of similarities I'm sure, there are also obviously differences. Differences in growing, post-grow processing, extraction, product formulation, etc. Although big tobacco currently has botanists and PhDs, I assume if they're already employed they probably are already working with tobacco. So again, goes back to the point of having to hire more people to pad the workforce to cover this new branch of operations. Or you could just buy out a company and get an operation that's already got some of that work done for you."
e4s3xpq;zachalicious;1535179293.0;"Adding to what Spiritual_Dragonfly said, cannabis is usually cloned as opposed to planted. It's also better to grow indoors with controlled environments. It's a completely different growing process because there can be drastic differences in quality. There's likely hundreds of different cannabis strains, all with different ratios of active compounds; I believe there's less than 30 different strains of tobacco. If big tobacco just wants to grow low quality cannabis of varying potency for cheap joints, sure, they could dominate that market. But the big bucks are in extracts, cartridges, edibles, and pills/capsules. Those require different manufacturing processes that tobacco doesn't currently have."
e4ry57k;Throwawayin2020;1535173694.0;"> It appears to me that farming is farmingNo...just..no. "
e4t0z9s;TidyGate1;1535228170.0;"Buy PM?"
e4u263s;Juniper00e;1535267756.0;"We don't really know if the risk for lung / throat cancer is less. Weed is typically thicker smoke and people tend to breathe it in much more deeply. Smoke no matter if THC or Nicotine is still a combustion product and is a carcinogen."
e4s6ajk;deadlock91;1535181688.0;"Yea it really depends on the timeframe if you need it in few months then acquisitions for sure if you started say a year ago /late last year , a year should be enough to get your own thing up and running.With acquisition now you're also paying high valuations on things your prob don't need like say accounting department ,hr ,office space ,growing facilities ect that they prob already have . Really depends how much foresight they had and how early they started getting things moving "
e4s5n7x;GoogleOfficial;1535181022.0;"That's a barrier for small companies, the big players will get it expedited"
e4rynhh;cognitive-dissonance;1535174152.0;"> Differences in growing, post-grow processing, extraction, product formulation, etc. Growing weed isn't rocket science.  Look at Oregon, the price of weed has been plummeting because of oversupply from mom and pop operations (The state has granted 1,001 producer licenses as of May. A gram fallen to $5).  There is not any significant barriers to entry in the farming industry.  Weed is as easy to grow as cabbage.  It as easy to dry as any spice, such as rosemary. What you are saying is analogous to saying that a cabbage farmer doesn't know how to grow broccoli.It would be one thing if companies like Canopy didn't have multi-billion dollar market caps."
e4ryyt4;cognitive-dissonance;1535174442.0;"Ok, why? From my understanding most of the complications come from the need to grow it indoors under expensive light setups.  That wouldn't be necessary if it was legal and you could grow it in outdoor greenhouses."
e4t13z0;Walden_Walkabout;1535228385.0;"I'm overall bearish on cigarettes. Worldwide shipments have started to decline, and the only reason they have been able to continue to increase earnings is with larger margins. Regulations keep tightening and the younger generation in a lot of places are not smoking. I would not invest in them just because you want exposure to the pot market."
e4v4j6p;Mr-_-Positivity;1535323937.0;"I spoke to my pulmonologist and he told me cannabis does not contain the chemicals of tobacco leading to COPD and cancer. Basically saying something else would get you first before cannabis "
DELETED;NoAuthor;-1;DELETED;
e4s05jy;Spiritual_Dragonfly;1535175547.0;"But that’s the difference between Oregon growers and Canopy. Canopy currently grows but the future value of the company depends on them executing on their value-added strategy. Growing weed isn’t rocket science, but the post processing, extraction, and product formulation methods involves plenty of science. In recent interviews, their CEO has said he doesn’t even care to own the growing assets because that’s not going to be where the money is.They want to change the dialogue from farming to pharma. It’s not about selling the plant. It’s about taking that plant, which we know has some medical properties, and unlocking it’s potential. A plant that has had limited scientific research done, and has not been commercialized at all. Even if cannabis isn’t the be-all end-all medical product that cures every diseases known to man, like some stoners would believe, it definitely has positive medical attributes that can help a variety of symptom and diseases from insomnia to Parkinson’s. Basically to me, these cannabis companies are a bet on the resourcefulness of mankind to commercialize a plant that hasn’t been commercialized like every other aspect of our western civilization.Imagine if corn was illegal and was being legalized. You’d be right to say, it’s just corn, anyone can grow corn, why’s this corn company worth so much. Skip 10 years down the line to the point where R&D scientists at that corn company have found out how to make corn based fructose syrup and it’s now in literally almost every single food product. That’s where corn goes from being just corn, to an ingredient in an array of products."
e4smb8d;rumplesnarky;1535199529.0;"Average weed or worse is easy to grow. Prime product which people are willing to pay top dollar for is hard to grow and labor intensive. "

e4scxm5;TrollBearPig-what;1535188699.0;"Being big and having alot of money doesn't solve all the slow-downs I mentioned. Buying an already successful Cannabis company reduces risk and time to market. A perfect example is Altria putting billions with a B invested into their in-house IQOS vape tech..only for it to be showing lack luster results"
e4u301w;Spiritual_Dragonfly;1535268668.0;"But you can patent the end products and goods created with cannabanoids in them. As well as the process to create them."
e4u4d26;lonewolf420;1535270142.0;"You can patent processes and genetic modifications. Yes you can patent your own strain if it was genetically modified in a novel way."
e4rzjk4;Throwawayin2020;1535174976.0;"Because you think farming is farming, lmao. "
e4sepku;THAWED21;1535190630.0;"Okay so they buy an existing business. Are we talking about the same thing? I'm saying regardless, tobacco doesn't have to engage at this point. Once they do decide to engage, they will dominate the market."

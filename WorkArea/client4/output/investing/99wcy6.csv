99wcy6;ragamuffinryan;1535136226.0;"When compared to other huge tech companies such as Google, Netflix, Microsoft. "

e4qvfn1;_NotWrongJustAsshole;1535136913.0;"Because it's priced as a hardware company. It always has been. Hardware companies are seen as similar to movie studios or games companies, hits driven businesses that are one bad release away from irrelevance. Apple has consistently delivered for years but the market thinks if the next iPhone sucks or whatever, the company is doomed. If you think the business is more like Google or Microsoft, then you have a tremendous value opportunity. Though it seems unlikely Mr. Market is going to be valuing them different anytime soon."

e4r2jdc;HulksInvinciblePants;1535146207.0;"I honestly think it's a side-effect of being the largest company, by market-cap. Investors are reluctant to push it much further, when its already sitting at the top, with its comparatively low P/E. People can claim it's a hardware vs software issue all they want, but in the end it's still a tech company. A highly-profitable tech company that's investing and succeeding in other segments beyond cellphones. There's little doubt they can afford some of the best and brightest when it comes to market trends and technological advancements. They're just a bit more secretive about what they're working on at any given time, so again, it leaves a degree of doubt in investors minds. "

e4qz3go;davida_usa;1535142314.0;"Because it is not expected to grow as rapidly as Google, Netflix or Microsoft. A company with steady earnings and no growth prospects might have a p/e of 10, while a company with modestly growling earnings has somewhat higher p/e (Apple is at about 18 TTM p/e and analysts estimate their 2019 revenue will grow 5% over 2018), and a company with more rapidly growing earnings is higher still (Alphabet has a TTM p/e of about 52 and analysts estimate their revenue growth will be 19% 2019 over 2018)."

e4qwh77;Doomsdayer;1535138660.0;"Some people also are under the impression that Apple is a premium product. Apple’s most recent iPhone was >$1,000 for a cellphone that is “consumed”/“replaced” nearly every 2-3 years. The number of $1,000 cell phones that can be sold is constrained to higher class and developed markets. There is not a global capacity to 2x or 3x the number of $1,000 cell phones they can sell. There are analysts who think the iPhone can still grow but the most profitable model has limited scalability.  (Not my primary opinion as Apple represents an ecosystem, gets a piece of each app, and is advancing into wearables, payment transactions, and likely a car)Netflix is able to expand into various markets and offer a $10-12 a month service that anyone can afford and get more usage from compared to an iPhone. "
e4qv8st;itsyaboi117;1535136578.0;"Researched it because I didn’t understand it myself but taken directly from investopedia: In general, a high P/E suggests that investors are expecting higher earnings growth in the future compared to companies with a lower P/E. A low P/E can indicate either that a company may currently be undervalued or that the company is doing exceptionally well relative to its past trends. When a company has no earnings or is posting losses, in both cases P/E will be expressed as “N/A.” Though it is possible to calculate a negative P/E, this is not the common conventionRead more: Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) Definition | Investopedia https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp#ixzz5P5k12nno "

e4ssrdf;bc289;1535210293.0;"This is the real reason: it's low because future growth expectations are much lower than the others. Rev expectations beyond this year are for low to mid single digit growth, and EPS expectations are for 10-15% EPS growth. Not bad, but it's low quality growth driven largely by share repurchases.&#x200B;Truth is that their revenue growth primarily comes from the iPhone, where there's heavy competition and is increasingly becoming more commoditized. Apple still stands out with their product, but it is becoming more difficult to do so. They're making small incremental changes to the iPhone and are running against some pushback from consumers on rising prices. So the upside to estimates as well does not appear that significant."
e4rco7p;massivewang;1535155307.0;"BECAUSE THEY'RE DOOMED!!!!!!!!!! /s"
e4qyb25;KingFlashBolt;1535141293.0;"I have no idea what some people are writing. Much of what they said have nothing to do with P/E at all.1) You can’t compare Apple’s P/E with Google. They are entirely different companies. Nor should you compare Apple with Netflix. Microsoft is a decent comparison. For reference, only compare the P/E of similar companies. I’d compare Facebook with Google and Snapchat with Twitter, etc.,2) P/E simply stands for price/earning. This is the formula from EPS (Earnings per share) - which is earnings after dividends/outstanding shares. So if Apple had earnings of $1,000,000 and preferred dividends of $100,000 for their 10,000 shares, their EPS would be $90. Meaning, each share earned $90. P/E is simply the price of the share/EPS. Using the same example, assume the price of Apple shares are $1,000 and the EPS is $90.  This gives a P/E ratio of 11.11 - which is very low and can mean several things. 3) A high P/E ratio can mean the company isn’t generating enough earnings. Some companies, like Netflix and Amazon, are aware of this and investors ignore their P/E because they both grow at a rapid rate. If you are investing into a high P/E company, you need to check if they are experiencing high growth. A low P/E ratio on the other hand can mean that the stock is undervalued (because the lower the P/E, the less you are paying for every dollar earned). On the other hand, you want to check if the company is growing. If not, there may be no movement in the share price because investors are unsure of the company. Simply looking at the P/E ratio is useless if you do not understand growth within the company. Ideally, what you want to look for are low P/E companies that have high growth. Remember: Stocks drop in value for various reasons. That 100% has a large effect on the P/E ratio and that is why stock screeners are used when looking for potential dips in a stock.4) If a stock does not show a P/E, then it’s due to it suffering a loss. You will only have a P/E if you generate earnings. Just as I mentioned before, You want to look at comparable P/E’s of companies in the sane industry. But that is not all: Let’s say you want to compare BABA with Amazon. There is more at play than P/E. Political indifferences, growth, leadership, trade conflicts, etc., are all concerns you need to account for.To summarize: Apple has a lower P/E ratio because they generate a lot of earnings and because of this, their shares seem undervalued. You want a lower P/E because it signifies how much you are paying for every dollar generated. Ex: Would you rather pay $20 for $1 earned or $15 for $1 earned? On the other hand, maybe their shares are valued the way they are because growth is declining, iPhone sales are less than projected, and maybe Macbook sales are down. It’s tough to say but this is where you have to insert your own level of strategies and make a decision. "
e4r9kmv;kirakun;1535152708.0;"Slightly off tangent question. Isn’t PE kinda arbitrary because the price of a stock depends on how many shares too? My company could be trading at $100 per share today, but tomorrow my stock splits. Suddenly my PE just halved."
e4r0xpb;The_Scalia_Playbook;1535144490.0;"Apple’s P/E is artificially deflated due to the excess cash it holds. Here’s a simple thought exampleCash trades at a P/E of 1. Imagine a company with $200bn in the bank. It has 1 share, it has no business, and no expenses. How much is that company currently worth? How much would you pay per share? Now translate this price to an implied P/E multiple. Let’s call this company CashCo.Now let’s add to this a self-sufficient, multi billion dollar FCF generating business (needs no additional non-incremental capital) with nominal debt. Let’s call this JobsCo. A combined company of CashCo and JobsCo, BigCo, is currently trading at a 20x fwd P/E.   Ignoring any extenuating factors or exotic capital structures or obligations, and knowing that CashCo trades at 1x P/E, is JobsCo being valued above or below the implied P/E of a combined BigCo?   I’ll give you a hint - BigCo is a real company!   Among other reasons, this is also a classic example of why EV/EBITDA is generally a much better metric than P/E, but still does not encompass the full picture!   While repurchases will move the share price, fundamental changes in valuation will only occur if the company’s prospects materially change.  "
e4r3z2h;yolochinesememestock;1535147718.0;"It's accurate."
e4tipbx;Surveyer13579;1535247916.0;"Here are the main reasons (in my mind). 1. Their annual revenue is growing below at 7%, which limits their futures earnings potential. 2. Their revenue is very contingent on the success of major product launches. They even showed negative revenue movement on a full year basis (2015 > 2016). 3. They're losing smartphone and tablet market share. They're printing money, but p/e ratios also reflect what investors think the company will be worth in the future. Netflix is growing faster, releasing quality products (movies) very frequently at the moment, and gaining market share --> hence, their higher P/E ratio. "
e4qymfj;secondnameIA;1535141707.0;"The answer is simple; their business advantage is less strong than other tech companies.Building a new social network, search engine, or worldwide software suite is almost impossible without being bought out first.

e4qxte3;G_Morgan;1535140618.0;"Well the market does regularly up value them but, unlike Amazon, Apple posts huge profit increases and the market just immediately uprates them to the same PE. So there is value there even if they never move out to PE of 40 because their earnings growth has historically been that damned good.AAPLs stock price doubling period isn't much larger than AMZN. They just did all that while always having the profit to back it up. Essentially Wallstreet has bet continually for about 10 years that this is it for AAPL and earnings growth in serious numbers cannot possibly happen. At this point AAPL has consistently defied that expectation with a begrudging upgrade."
e4r1y0z;The_Law_of_Pizza;1535145593.0;"Which isn't necessarily wrong.Apple makes a high quality product, but there's no denying that it's also a status symbol. Apple is never going to implode overnight, or from one bad release. But a bad release *could* start the slippery slide to losing its social status as the premium product. Or their "walled garden," and "it just works" approach could end up becoming a liability in the same way. Right now, it's viewed as a selling point - but what happens if management makes a bad decision and the walled garden doesnt adopt the next big thing (video format, etc)? Suddenly it could be seen as archaic and needlessly restrictive. It may not sink the company overnight, but losing its status as the premier brand would crush the company's value."

The last real market-making product they had was the iPad in 2010.  There have been various failed internal (e.g., autonomous car; iTV; photography revolution; education revolution) and varyingly successful external (e.g., AppleWatch) initiatives since then to make a new market, but nothing's struck with quite the same lightning.I say all this while holding a large position in $AAPL.  Like you say, they're great at doubling down for now on the product lines they do have; they've become a brand unto themselves unlike almost any other in the world.  I'm confident in the short-to-medium term growth trajectory of the company.  I think the long-run becomes much cloudier.  Of course, investors have lived and died on their (in)ability to separate out the breakpoint between those two time horizons--as some point, the "long term" becomes "now.""

What I'm talking about is strategic marketing, not operatoins. They've always done this. Rather than reducing the price of a product that is no longer cost competitive after being on the market, they slide in a next gen product at the same price. The next gen product has better margins than the previous gen due to reused technologies, tooling, less waste in more refined process etc. In your example of the iPhone 4S, they reduced cost during that period but they also reduced manufacturing volume. Volume for their newest gen product stays the same or increases making it more profitable. The majority of their profit at any given time is from the iteration of their newest gen products. For example, the first iPad, I believe, was almost not profitable at all. Yes they also eek out profit through forced continuous improvement in their supply chain, similar to the automotive industry, but that is reduction of overhead not value generation."

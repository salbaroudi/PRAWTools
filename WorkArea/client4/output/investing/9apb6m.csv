9apb6m;blkblade;1535408339.0;"I'm holding a stock with some gains. I am thinking of hedging (short selling the same position) to secure some gains. The reason I want to do this, is to maintain my original cost basis, and hold it long enough to sell for long term gains at some point. If the stock keeps rising, and I decide to close my short at a loss, does this count as a loss that can be deducted from the yearly overall gains?"

e4x2txo;inevitable08;1535410115.0;"You can’t sellshort a stock you are long in the same account. They would just neutralize any long exposure you have equal to the amount you would shortsell. Anywho... you only deduct from your income if you have a net loss on the year... if your hedge causes you to have a net loss of all your positions then it wasn’t a really good hedge and you were really delta short. But you have to account for all net gains and net losses of all your positions and all your accounts. "

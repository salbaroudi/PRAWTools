9aa7nk;JogyNo;1535260449.0;US stock market ETF fo EU citizens
9aa7nk;JogyNo;1535260449.0;"Hey,I am from central Europe and was buying SP500 ETF (IVV) for the last 2 years, but I am no longer able to due to the new EU regulation...What is the best way to participate in the US stock market for EU citizens like me, if I am not confident enough to buy individual stocks yet? I know about the UCITS ETFs with domicile in EU (IUSA), but the liquidity is so low. Is there any risk asociated with ETFs with low liquidity?Thanks for the answers.TL;DR: what is the best SP500 ETF for EU investors after the new EU regulation."

e4u0lr7;amy31415;1535266036.0;"VUSA looks to have reasonably good liquidity."
e4twuro;decimalplaces;1535262170.0;"Another dumb EU regulation, them assuming people can't read English. Rant over."
e4u8b3z;dudadudadei;1535274361.0;"Buy for example Vanguard sp 500 on the Amsterdam euronext market. That's what I do"
e4u6adr;P0RTILLA;1535272255.0;"Can you just reach out to a US brokerage and ask about opening an account stateside? With TD Ameritrade a lot of ETFs can be traded 24/5. "
e4ur07d;Spoooderr;1535300081.0;"I ran into a very similar problem a few months back. I switched to VUSA from Vangaurd. However I’m still quite pissed off at the EU regulations as I can’t buy some of the smaller ETFs situated in the US. Also depending on your country you may pay 15% more tax over your dividends. "
e4uwxol;Newacountero;1535313510.0;"Its easy. Look what kind of index does the ETF track. Open https://www.justetf.com/de-en/find-etf.html and on the left side search for it in the Matching indices field. In your case its the S&P 500. Then you can narrow the search down with other fields like accumulating vs distributing dividend.This site saved me after the new regulation. And actually its better anyway to buy it like this, because in my case I prefer accumulating dividends for tax reasons. Dividends are taxed, but there is no capital gain tax for 1 year+ investments in our EU country."
e4uxm2g;v-squid;1535314721.0;"I'd choose an ETF that reinvests dividends to you avoid getting taxed on those. My pick is iShares Core S&P500 (SXR8 or CSPX depending on venue9."
e4u3v5d;Espeide;1535269601.0;"This is the one im currently investing in.I haven't figured out why sometimes it is compeltly inverse from the VOO(which it should be tracking?), but the end-of-month average is usually ok."
e4uoep3;JogyNo;1535294765.0;"The liquidity is even lower than IUSA... Do u guys see any risk associated with it? I am not sure about risk coming from ETFs in general (what happens if iShares or Vanguard goes bankrupt?) and that low volume just doesn't make me more comfortable..But that is for another topic, probably.."
e4twyzo;JogyNo;1535262290.0;"100% agree. Just was wondering what is the best way around it."
e4txl8t;DeeDee_Z;1535262901.0;"True statement; but is it helpful to OP, or does it come -anywhere- close to answering the OP's question?"
e4uojlg;JogyNo;1535295015.0;"Similar to the iShares IUSA, but thanks."
e4uhu5g;not83_1;1535284925.0;"I tried that. Signing up for TD Ameritrade was an absolute pain in the ass. Had to international call their US number because they can't do it online, but also international calls can't do toll free numbers and the only thing they list *everywhere* is the toll free US number.Once I had called they told me I had to fax in a form. fax?! in 2018?!"
e4ux11i;JogyNo;1535313678.0;"Will check that out, thanks!"
e4v5llg;Jonathan_Bercow;1535325110.0;"ishares core sp500 etf is domiciled in Ireland and any fund domiciled in Ireland pays 20% tax on dividends that it as a fund receives, so even if it reinvests them or if you hold it in a tax sheltered account, it will pay that tax which you won't be eligible for any tax relief for because the fund paid it, not you. "
e4ud41g;smeznaric;1535279481.0;"If it's listed in Europe it might have a different daily close due to the timezone difference."
e4uo8f3;JogyNo;1535294437.0;"It is traded in EUR (GDP, CHF) so the exchange rate is also counted in. In the long run it matches."
e4uofsa;JogyNo;1535294822.0;"Well thanks, at least I don' see that as an option now."
e4v4ie4;TerminalJealousity;1535323911.0;"It's been 10 years since I've even seen a fax machine. I wouldn't even know where to find one!"
e4ux4bf;Newacountero;1535313845.0;"Yeah, its a great site. It displays only ETFs that you can buy as an EU citizen."
e4utsys;Espeide;1535306694.0;"I am aware of that, but it does not explain why it closes sometimes -0.25% when the S&P was green all day. They it recovers the day after *usually*."
e4ux6d5;P0RTILLA;1535313947.0;"Faxing a form does seem like a high barrier to entry. "
e4wlz1p;PersecuteThis;1535384347.0;"Your local hospital! :)"
e4yjdki;blorg;1535460710.0;"There are web fax services for this now."
e4uu2nu;JogyNo;1535307348.0;"It may explain that perfectly, it depends what EUR/USD does."

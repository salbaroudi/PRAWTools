9a84ih;Justsomeone82;1535244087.0;"As a college student I remember going to see a fee only financial adviser with my mom. It left a bad taste in my mouth. The financial adviser had my mom in a multi-year Jackson National Life annuity and actively managed mutual funds that were front-loaded (fee charged hen purchased).As I got more life experience, I learned about the **efficient market hypothesis** and therefore learned that **indexing** makes the most sense. Buying and holding for the long term. I came to the conclusion that a Vanguard-type index fund or **ETF** is a wise choice; or, arguably a **dozen or two of diversified stocks**.And I also came to the conclusion that the financial manager my mom used likely only offered what he offered because: 1) He could only offer certain financial products through his organization, and they were not the right ones (he was independent but worked through LPL); 2) Multi-year annuities can "lock-in" the customer--he could keep getting his fee because she could not get out--there was a financial penalty to get out of the annuity too early. 3) Maybe he thought that if we knew that all we had to do was index through Vanguard maybe he would worry that we could figure it out on our own and no longer need his services.But what I have also found out is that **even investing as simple as index funds is outside the grasp or interest of some people.** I have aunts, uncles, and friends who are clueless about these funds, how to allocate based on their age, etc. **I can see myself being a fee only financial adviser who actually looks first for clients' interest**. **I could in no way feel good about myself selling financial products that I would never buy for myself.**I did some searching online and there are some fee-only financial advisers that simply index and allocate for the clients without long-term commitments that are common to annuities. I also imagine it will be harder going this route to make money but I was to be honest and ethical.**If I go this route, how will I get my management fee?** I know some fee-based planners bill the clients quarterly for arrears based on assets under management, although I would prefer to have it automatically withdrawn somehow--is that possible? **Is fee-based financial planning using an indexed approach viable as a career?** Thoughts? By the way I can't stand tax and want to avoid that area as much as possible and stick with investing--I would refer to a CPA.​​​​"

e4tn1xh;SirGlass;1535252178.0;"The issue is you would have to be fee based and charge a hourly fee and you would have to bill the clients I don't see how you can have it automatically with drawn from their accountThis is why most financial advisers steer you to front loaded mutual funds, they get the front load as a commission or they steer you to their own firms high expense ratio funds and their firm then gives a commission from their higher expense ratio .However one thing to think about is investing is really easy now, and anyone that owns a smart phone or has access to a computer can setup a schwab/fedility/vangaurd fund or go with something like betterment or M1 finance that all have robo advisers.The issue is your market will be1. People with money to invest2. People that are computer illiterate Sure there is a market but its small and going to get smaller in the future as 1 & 2 don't really go hand in hand.Not saying you shouldn't do it but just to put some things into perspective "
e4tg8ft;Joeyschmo102;1535245495.0;"Don't you have to be certified to give any information? "
e4tp1pp;bms0430;1535254209.0;"I agree with your thinking, there's room for something between really expensive & underperforming Edward Jones advisors and everyone's accounts being totally self-directed.  I think you could charge 25 to 50 basis points for such a service.  There is a retired advisor posting on the Bogleheads board who used that business model, though his name escapes me."
e4u320z;thezander8;1535268729.0;"Almost everything you said is viable and almost nothing is new.Independent fee-only financial advisors who support the best interests of their clients exist -- I met quite a few of them through my MBA capstone project, which was consulting in the financial services industry. I can't say if such firms were 100% in index funds, but they were advertising portfolio returns as only one of many planning, tax, etc services they offered.If you're not working for a major firm who's paying commissions for you to sell products, then the primary value you give to your clients is keeping someone knowledgeable in between them and their investments so they don't panic and do stupid stuff with their money during market swings without someone stopping them. The assets themselves being in index funds -- when you said it yourself, clients may not even know what index funds are -- doesn't change that value proposition at all.You can calculate it yourself to see if the finances work out. A 1% management fee with an average client asset value of 100k means that you'll need 70 clients to reach 70k in revenue. You can definitely beat a 100k average if you pick up some wealthy clients or folks who have already saved a lot for retirement.I think some people are being a little snarky here because your treatise here only accomplishes the very easiest part of the process. Yes indexing is better and yes you can make money as a fee-only advisor. Now you need to research the industry like crazy and look into what it will take to get the Series 65 license (and preferably the CFP) as well as things like omissions and errors insurance, business licensing, purchasing books of clients, and custodial firms.Alternatively/also, you should see if there are any fee-only firms in your area that meet your description (I guarantee you there are some if you live in a major city) through web searching or networking through the FPA or something, and possibly see if they'd be willing to take you on as an associate advisor. Being in someone else's firm without having to set up the business from scratch, and possible getting in line to succeed them and handle their clients after they retire, is a very attractive option for someone just starting out."

e4tp3pj;RTiger;1535254267.0;"I would discourage you. There isn't a lot of money in that arena, and robots can do the job described for next to nothing. Young people are more likely to trust a robot. Older  investors tend to already have an advisor or feel comfortable going alone.Certified Financial Analyst certification is a possibility, but it is a long hard road before a person can do portfolio management. Compliance and other back office tasks are part of the climb up."

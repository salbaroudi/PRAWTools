99z9ho;KillingTime56;1535159584.0;Will your "retirement income" be similar to your last salary working
99z9ho;KillingTime56;1535159584.0;"When you retire do you expect to have a similar income to that of your last job.  I retirement income as a combination of Social Security, pensions, withdrawals from investments, passive income and part time work.If your standard of living is going to be less in retirement than when you were working, how are you going to handle the loss of income?"

e4rj2ie;Hablamanos3;1535160643.0;"Look at it in terms of your annual spending, not your annual salary"
e4ri4up;SirGlass;1535159873.0;"No should aim maybe for 80%Why?When you are working you should be saving at least 10-15% for retirement anyway so once you are retired you do not have those expesesyou should also try to have your home paid off and live mortgage free."
e4rkz1a;KillingTime56;1535162209.0;"Many financial experts say you NEED 100% of your last salary in retirement.Others say you need a lot less because:1) You are no longer setting aside any money for retirement.2)  Your taxes will be lower because most of your income is capital gains and Social Security and you pay limited Social Security taxes anymore unless you work for lots of money. &#x200B;"
e4rhxkq;Digging_For_Ostrich;1535159704.0;"Not many people on the planet manage the same income post-working as they do when in employment.You manage the loss of income by assuming your costs of living are reduced. Those who own their property for example, will not have to continue paying rent or a mortgage.Other than, people make do."
e4rovm4;__Levi;1535165545.0;"Mine will be way lower.  :D  Most of my income goes into saving for retirement though, so I think that is fine."
e4rlfm5;bmwkbiker;1535162594.0;"No....* My marginal tax rate is almost 50%* I save >20% of my after tax incomeTherefore, I'm supporting my current lifestyle with only 30-40% of my gross incomeWhen I "retire" * My marginal tax rate will be lower for a number of reasons* I'll be selling (some) assets to generate spendable cash flow (for taxable accounts only the dividends/capital gains generate taxable income)"
e4rr3gj;stockpikr;1535167463.0;"Although my work related gross income is less now than when I was working, my work related net income is higher because I now collect social security instead of paying for it, I now collect my pension instead of paying for it, and I now have a free employer paid medical plan instead of paying my employer for it. All said and done, my work related net income is 3% higher than when I was working and the COLA adjustments in SS and my pension tend to be greater than the increases in pay when I was working."
e4rvztw;jsf67;1535171758.0;"My wife and I are close to retirement, still mostly supporting four adult sons.  Fortunately we saved enough and invested it well enough that money is unlikely to be a problem in retirement.    One of our sons doesn't actually need the support we provide.  Two others seem to be on their way to not needing it.  When my wife and I retire, I expect we will travel more and spend more.  Maybe that will be balanced by reduction in the support we give our sons, so our total annual expenses might be the same as now.  But without a big drop in the market we would have no real problem increasing our annual expenses when we stop working."
e4s0m0y;jaghataikhan;1535175998.0;"I'll probably need more due to travel, healthcare, hobbies I now have time for (eg surfing, skiing, etc)"
e4tkqom;billbixbyakahulk;1535249915.0;"No.  My current annual spending is about 1/3 what I earn.  I don't plan for it to exceed 1/2 in any persistent time frame.  My current retirement conservative numbers indicate  I'll be earning about 60-70% of my final pay at my peak.  A little more when SS kicks in."
e4siaey;ScottishTrader;1535194629.0;"As others point out.No, but my expenses have dropped considerably from when I was working.  Not going to work saves a lot, gas, car maintenance, lunches, clothes, etc. have been far reduced.  Then, the kids are out of the house and most everything is paid off or less cost than before.So, I have less income but my standard of living has actually improved in many areas.  I havenâ€™t even started collecting SSI yet, so that will be extra fun money when it starts."
e4rsuys;CalPolyJohn;1535168994.0;"Also less cost for driving to work, lunches with coworkers, etc. if you do those things. More free time to DIY things including cooking."
e4sp1u7;JSmurfington;1535203557.0;"Follow up question... when is a Roth IRA ever a good idea then?  The determination of whether it is better than a traditional is whether your tax rate will be higher or lower when you retire.  But since your income is almost always lower when you retire, why use a Roth?"
e4s0ehs;Worf_Of_Wall_St;1535175783.0;"For most people mortgage interest is one of their largest expenses and that shouldn't exist in retirement either."
e4rlqr1;DeeDee_Z;1535162858.0;"> most of your income is capital gains Hardly.  ALL of our income is fully taxable, since it's coming out of our IRAs -- exactly according to plan."
e4s8jhq;v1d5r;1535184063.0;"The problems start when your job keeps you from pursuing the expensive hobbies you enjoy"
e4t0kap;crydriverr;1535227460.0;"This thread is comparing salary immediately before retirement with retirement income basically the next year. If you make $70k in your 20's and $200k in your 60's, then your marginal rate in your 20s is more likely to be lower than your marginal rate in retirement."
e4sbmsv;CalPolyJohn;1535187285.0;"As a golfer, I can relate to that. Haha"

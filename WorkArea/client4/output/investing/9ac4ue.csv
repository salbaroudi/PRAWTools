9ac4ue;smellypants;1535277530.0;"Are dividend payouts transparent?  I have my retirement and brokerage account through Fidelity.  Thanks!"

e4ueg70;whoknowzz;1535281003.0;"The yield is your payout. What do you mean transparent?"
e4uk02w;GaylrdFocker;1535287742.0;"Why are you invested in Vanguard funds at Fidelity?"
e4uqz6k;red_five_standingby;1535300019.0;"get a vanguard account.  all vanguard etfs plus 1800 other etfs are commission free.  I'm pretty sure fidelity charges.  (Also, fyi, i own VOO and VTI)."
e4uenif;smellypants;1535281235.0;"Sorry for the ignorance, but as in do I have to do anything?  I don't want it sitting as cash primarily.  "
e4uqw9g;smellypants;1535299842.0;"Most of my funds are there (every 401k I’ve ever had has been through fidelity).  I prefer Vanguard funds, though as they have some of the lower expenses."
e4uezn4;whoknowzz;1535281622.0;"I believe (someone correct me if I’m wrong) fidelity allows you to setup dividend reinvestment which would make it automatic. Otherwise it will just sit in your account as cash.Mutual funds you can buy fractional shares and typically this is done automatically. "
e4uf3iu;Kierik;1535281744.0;"There is a settings for allowing DRIP on dividends stocks.when turned on it automatically reinvests the dividends. For my 401k it's auto enabled but not for my IRA with fidelity. "
e4v62qe;GaylrdFocker;1535325622.0;"Fidelity has cheaper mutual funds than Vanguard's ETF or MF now with they recent price reduction.  You are probably paying additional fee everytime you purchase more shares."
e4ug6d0;smellypants;1535282961.0;"Perfect.  I just checked and I had "deposit to core account"--changed to reinvest--thank you!"

9a1wll;mmccanndotcom;1535179044.0;What are your current positions? What are you researching? What do you look for?
9a1wll;mmccanndotcom;1535179044.0;"My positions...* AXXN - Taser company...but they have a great razor/blade model around police body cameras in addition to their taser brand moat...and sweet, sweet stable government contracts.* ALB - I love lithium mines.  Batteries are the future.  Risk here is global instability and some magic-tech that creates better batteries that don't require lithium.* AMZN - Amazon runs the world.  I don't see that changing.* BRKB - Warren Buffet is my hero.  They own a diverse set of businesses with strong individual moats.* CF - They can make it cheaper, faster and in higher quantity than anyone else.  Good management and good price moat.* FMC - Lithium seems like a good long term bet and FMC will be spinning off it's lithium business in Q4 allegedy.  I want that spinoff.  I'll probably have a strong inclination to sell FMC and keep it's lithium spinoff after that happens.* MTCH - They own basically every single dating site that matters.  They're good about buying competitors before they become a threat and they are good at growth an monetizing that growth.* SFIX - A gamble but I love the leadership, the business is performing well and it's an innovative idea that seems to have really caught fire.* SQ - I like the leadership, the numbers and the sector they're in.  Cashless is the future and they're leading the way.  Brand moat seems solid.  I'm only concerned that it's pretty easy to switch away from them.Currently looking into: Ali Baba (I like them long term; I like them even more if I get a discount due to a temporary trade war panic) and Home Depot (I don't really trust their CEO but the business is performing gangbusters and home repair isn't something that will disappear)."

e4s5sy9;becuziwasinverted;1535181185.0;"AMZN - obvious - 18%FB - lots of cash & room to monetize - 30 % MSFT - azure  - 14 %V - cuz debt will never go away! - 14 %BABA - so cheap right now, in 2 years, it’ll be the one that got away, I expect same growth as amazon - 17 % DBX - cuz cloud - 3 % "
e4sf74n;SpeedyClaxton99;1535191163.0;"* SQ - 43%. Big fan of SQ. Their point-of-sale payment system is just the beginning. They are creating a vertically-integrated business "ecosystem" that provides different services to businesses (payments, analytics, deposits, invoices, payroll, employee management, inventory management, etc. etc. etc.). Square is also in the process of getting a bank charter (still have some technical kinks to work out) which would allow them to provide loans to all of these businesses they conveniently integrated themselves into.  Square will basically have their hand open collecting a % every time a business does *anything*. Big potential.* MSFT - 20%. I like MSFT for several reasons. Their CEO is fantastic. They offer Azure (lots of growth in cloud computing), Office, Windows, Xbox, etc.  Great company.* UNH - 17%. I'm in healthcare and have experience dealing with insurance companies. Financially speaking, the winners in the healthcare industry are the insurance companies. UNH is the big toad in the puddle.* ADBE - 12%. Subscription payment model on software that pretty much every company uses and is loyal to. Companies spend fortunes on advertising and the people that create those various forms of media use ADBE.* APH - 8% - They make electrical components, connectors, specialty cables, antennas, sensors, etc. Leading supplier of cable solutions for military and commercial aerospace. Have their hands in industrial, automotive, IT/data centers, and wireless network industries. They literally connect the world."

e4s92xm;yellowhorseNOT;1535184633.0;"AVXL"
e4sc9vh;notkiwihaqi;1535187980.0;"For Individual stocks? 100% AMD, have been since May.Bear in mind though, at the time it only made up 20% of my portfolio. It's close to 35% atm. I plan on holding them until 7nm comes out, then reasses the landscape (it depends on NVDA/INTC's competition). I don't intend to increase/decrease my position at any point"
e4s7t3f;p10_user;1535183283.0;"In response to DBX - what about Box? On the surface they seem very very similar. "
e4s83tj;Revolver123;1535183602.0;"How are we so sure about Baba? China is not a capitalist economy with little regulation. "
e4s80py;becuziwasinverted;1535183511.0;"I went with one that I knew, drop box has some great collaborative services and only a handful of customers pay for services, Imo, drop box is a good M&A target for the big boys (AMZN, MSFT, etc ) "
e4s8su6;mmccanndotcom;1535184338.0;"My feeling (to be researched to confirm) is that Ali Baba is so central to the chinese economy - being the middle man - that the Chinese government won't let them fail (just like the US wouldn't let GM fail)."
e4s8pv3;becuziwasinverted;1535184251.0;"We’re not sure and there’s some questions about their honesty regarding their financials ( cooked books and the like ) But there’s enough on paper that they can take on amazon. "
e4says6;JustAsIgnorantAsYou;1535186583.0;"Whenever people say stuff like that I wonder whether or not they take into consideration that the common stock went to 0."

9aegyb;red_five_standingby;1535305914.0;"I'm getting increasingly nervous and would like to preserve my retirement and stock investment gains.  I was going to shift all my retirement investments into a money market around mid January,  but had serious personal issues to deal with and missed doing that.  then at the end of january, the dow jones industrial average tanked a bit and i thought i missed the boat in not doing the shifting thing.  Now, things have recovered from that (and nasdaq hitting new highs seemingly daily) but am getting nervous there will be a more serious correction or even a crash.   I really consider myself an amateur in investing, so any insight or opinion would be welcome.  This bull market can't go on forever. Thank you.edit:  Also, any comment or insight into why Mark Cuban has gotten out of the market and shorting?

e4v18ej;RTiger;1535319981.0;"If a person is skittish, reduce equity allocation by 5 or 10 percent. Still feel that way in six months, reduce a bit more.All in, all out moves tend to end badly. More than a few got out before or just after the 2016 election and still are waiting for a bear market.The market may end with a blow off top. A rapid acceleration to the upside that gets most bears to jump back in. January 2018 was like that, 1 or 2 percent up every week got a lot of fish to bite. Timing the top is a low probability game. Mostly it is the lucky and liars that get out near the top."
e4uvco8;Donnie-Jon-Hates-You;1535310339.0;"There needs to be a catalyst.The catalyst has always been debt default.The key thing to watch for is servicing the interest on debt being dependent on rolling that debt over into new debt.  When that mechanism stops working, there will be a correction.  Rising interest rates make this more probable.  Unfortunately debt refinancing (roll over) is a horribly opaque process.  To me, the canary in the coal mine will be when buy-backs slow down or stop all together.  Right now, buy-backs are being fueled, not by low interest as they have been in the past, but via repatriated cash thanks to tax reform.  When that money runs out and interest rates have risen, the buy-backs will stop and the refinancing will cease to be feasible.  Then you'll get your precious crash.  I'm thinking about the middle of Trump's second term."

e4vf0xj;zachmoe;1535334514.0;"Actually soon imo.​And I'm the biggest irrational permabull here.​The way I see it, eventually long bond rates will finally bottom (where it is a great investment until), and start capitulating which will make long bonds uninvestible for a while, and at the same time short term rates hit 4%.​When short term rates hit 4% everything comes crashing down.​But I don't expect it to be a long downturn, as much as just a sharp decline in price.  But what do I know?"

e4v8575;userandaloser;1535327745.0;"You need to look at you time horizon and decide what level or risk you can handle. If there is a correction or a downturn, do you have time to ride it out, or do you need to take money out for retirement in the next 3-5 years?I would suggest moving some of your money into bonds and keeping some in stocks, depending on your age.

A friend got out before the 2008 correction and got back in shortly after it started climbing again.  Doing this would preserve a huge amount of gains.  But, maybe timing the market is a pipe dream."

e4w7wz6;zachmoe;1535364060.0;"Sure, my understanding is the risk free rate is a part of the calculation for stock price.  If the risk free rate goes up stock prices will go down.  The correlation between short term bond rates rising and a market crash is because if I can get 4% for much less duration risk than a 10 yr or 30 yr and no equity risk, there is no reason to have anything else."
e4vrt4t;RTiger;1535346831.0;"For every lucky person that got it right, probably ten got it wrong. Many more sold at the bottom than bought. Who even knows if your friend is telling the truth? Lots of market fish stories get told. The fish gets bigger with each telling. Market tops need a relative maximum number of buyers relative to sellers. Bottoms the opposite. That's one reason timing is so difficult, because people being cautious makes a top far less likely. "

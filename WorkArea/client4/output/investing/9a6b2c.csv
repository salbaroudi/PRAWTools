9a6b2c;AutoModerator;1535227513.0;"If your question is "I have $10,000, what do I do?" or anything similar. There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer* How old are you?* Are you employed/making income? How much?* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?* Any big debts?* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!"

e4u1yrq;okaywhattho;1535267535.0;"22 years old. Variable income. Objective is to keep myself up to speed with global company movements while potentially making (Or losing money) on their developments. High risk tolerance. Currently hold everything in cash/ETFs. No asset holdings or debt. Time horizon I'd probably split up into 5, 20, 30 years. I just want as many opinions about the best stock to jump into medium-long term. I'm wholly behind ETFs because I do not believe that I have the knowledge to beat the market. That being said, I do believe that there are companies that, long-term, will outperform all of my own ETFs. Two that pop into my head are Apple and Amazon. So, am I right or am I wrong? And, further to that, where should I be putting my money in stocks with long(er)-term growth in mind?  "

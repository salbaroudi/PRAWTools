9an93c;KillingTime56;1535387862.0;"Everyone on this board wants dividends!  High dividends, growing dividends, dividend ETF's, DIVIDENDS, DIVIDENDS, and More DIVIDENDS!Trouble is in reality a stock dividend is noting more than an accounting gimmick!  There is really no value in getting a dividend anymore.  Yes, before people could buy and sell stocks online, dividends were helpful in creating income without the hassle of actually selling shares of stocks.  But now with low or no transaction fees, there is little reason to even think about dividends. If you want income from your stocks to pay expenses, just sell shares on a scheduled basis.Many investors think that getting a stock dividend is like getting interest on your money from a bank account.  It's not! When a stock, Mutual Fund or ETF pays a dividend, the NAV (Value) of the stock will go down an equal amount than the dividend the evening before the dividend is paid.  If you reinvest the investment, you come out even.   If you pull out the dividend payment out of your account, you basically just did a scheduled withdrawal.Many people who don't understand dividends will buy shares of the investment a few days before the stock is scheduled to pay a dividend and then sell it right after the dividend is paid.  They think they are making money this way.  They may make money if the value of the stock goes up, but that increase has nothing to do with a dividend being paid.  If you could make money buying and selling within a few days around dividend payment, every hedge fund and other investors would do that and make trillions.  There is no free lunch when it comes to dividends.On the other hand, if you have money in a bank paying interest, you come out ahead every time interest is paid.Dividends are more or less an accounting gimmick!Check these out if you don't believe me.  (It is about mutual funds but is true with individual stocks, ETF's, REITS, and Mutual Funds.&#x200B;[https://soundmindinvesting.com/articles/view/how-fund-distributions-affect-fund-share-prices](https://soundmindinvesting.com/articles/view/how-fund-distributions-affect-fund-share-prices)[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/090415/how-do-dividends-affect-net-asset-value-nav-mutual-funds.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/090415/how-do-dividends-affect-net-asset-value-nav-mutual-funds.asp)"

e4wsozb;50calPeephole;1535398380.0;"Its early in my morning and the coffee is not strong with me.    Say I buy 100 shares of a stock with a 3% dividend and 100 shares of an equally priced non dividend stock and held them both..    Let's say a quarter goes by, both stocks perform identically, and I sell scheduled shares of the non interest bearing stock slightly off reports through a non transaction fee service and hold my interest stocks.  I've just earned 3% in interest minus taxes, and subsequently got hit with short term gains on my quarterly sale.    Now, the only way to really profit from the transaction is to buy back lower than my sell point (accounting of course for taxes) so that lies on the stock price going down not up, but I still need a fairly considerable swing...    Or, I could just ride out the dividends, forget the short term capital gains, and remember that time in the market beats most things.    Now. I'm not saying go all interest bearing stocks- a healthy portfolio mixes up your stock options, but this really seems like you only have half a grasp at what you're talking about."

Is that risk represented as alpha (lagging behind the index) or beta (stock price variability)? 7 - how much of an issued dividend ends up back at the company via reinvestment?There's tones of other uncomfortable questions that can be asked about dividend issuing companies, but that's left as an exercise for the non-lazy reader."

e4x1lk4;Nettletooth;1535408949.0;"Dividends are, from what I can see, an absolutely essential part of the stock market as a whole.Why I say this:  what makes a company valuable, on a completely fundamental level, isn't how much profit it generates or how much revenue it creates, but in the end, its ability to promise to remit dividends to its shareholders at some point.What I mean by this is this:  If a company was unable to ever give out a dividend for some reason, what value would there be in holding it?  If a company cannot remit value to me as a shareholder at some point, now or in the future, why am I a shareholder?  Why are these shares actually worth anything?  What other way can a company give me value?Dividends are certainly not an accounting gimmick.  Dividends are the underlying reason why we own stock, unless you really are that guy that owns F for the Ford Shareholder discount or Own BRK.B so you get your 5% off geico."

I'll probably get flamed by all the dividend investors out there, but there's a lot of evidence to suggest that dividends aren't something you should specifically seek out.  As KarateF22 points out, Berkshire never pays dividends (except once, and Buffett said he must have been in the bathroom when the decision was made).  And you can achieve the same thing using a total return approach and just selling stock to have "self made" dividends instead. (And for most folks that's more tax efficient than dividends, again as Karate points out.)  There seems to be a real cult of dividends here and elsewhere on the internet, but I think it's mostly unsubstantiated.  I can supply references if somebody goes ape shit over this.That said, it's is indeed stupid to say that a savings account is an alternative to stocks.

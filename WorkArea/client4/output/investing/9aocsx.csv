9aocsx;AutoModerator;1535400329.0;"If your question is "I have $10,000, what do I do?" or anything similar. There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer* How old are you?* Are you employed/making income? How much?* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?* Any big debts?* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!"

e4x1mdq;TypicalCupcake;1535408971.0;"Hello, Iâ€™m a young professional looking to get some feedback on my current financial situation. Currently employed full time (5 years) and part time enrolled in graduate school. SAVINGS/INVESTMENTS- 5% 401k contribution/matches, current value ~$12k ; vested. Edit: this is maxing the employer matching. - $2,500 Roth IRA annual contribution, current value ~$5k- $12k money market - $5k roboadvisor with 60/40 strategy DEBTS- $0 credit card debt, but used regularly with excellent credit and good history- $47k federal student loans ($22k unsubsidized) 3-7% ranging interest rates, not anticipating any additional student loans EXPENSES -$850-$1k monthly Looking for feedback on how to allocate my future monthly savings. Should I tackle student loans (subsidized loans currently deferred while in school)? Beef up 401k and/or Roth? Contribute more to roboadvisor? Add to money market? A new strategy all together?Edit: $62k salary My salary is reasonably expected to increase about 12% each year for the next three years. I was also contemplating purchasing a rental property...? My 5-year goal would be purchasing my own property in lieu of renting. All suggestions / feedback / criticism welcomed. Thank you. "
e4x5lfr;ntv1000;1535412646.0;"Hello! Here's my situation: I'm a 22 year old university student and I legally got a hold of the equivalent of around 60000 USD (I'm located in Europe). No debt, no financial responsibilities. I guess I won't need any of this money for at least the next 3 years as that will be the time when I'll be finishing my studies. I basically don't know the best way to put it to use. I've been reading some random stuff about investment recently and I'm thinking about starting to put like 5k into some stocks and index funds basically to dip my toes into the water a little bit. I'm looking for some suggestions and pointers for what's the best thing to do for my future.  Some specific questions: Is it even worth the effort/the risk to invest in my position, given that I have essentially no clue and experience in this or would it be smarter to just let it sit on my account for later? Would it be worth it to go to my bank and simply ask them what to do or is that just asking to be taken advantage of?"
e4x5a7a;throwawayinvestacct;1535412369.0;"What are the specific loans and their interest rates? You say "3-7%" which, for this discussion, is a *very* broad range. Probably for the 5+% loans (and almost certainly the 6+%ers), put your "extra" money towards that until they're paid down. Lower interest loans you're probably better off long-term paying only what's required and investing extra money elsewhere. Obviously a deferral changes the math, but the point is that whatever interest you're paying is the guaranteed return you get by putting extra money towards that loan principal. Since the broad market returns (with volatility) something like 6-7% annually long-term, after inflation, the guaranteed return of loan repayment starts sounding better and better as you approach 5+%."
e4x4s7f;YesThisIsBare;1535411925.0;"Max your Roth before you add more to your robo account, which I'm assuming is a taxable account. 60/40 is way conservative for a young person anyway.I would start making payments on the highest interest rate student loans you have, since it's a guaranteed 7% (or whatever rate) return. Dedicate some of each paycheck to your student loans and make those payments part of your budget. If you're comfortable with $12k in the money market being your emergency fund, I'd start making extra payments to those loans after you've maxed the Roth.I'd also advise taking a portion of each annual raise you get and sending it to your 401(k). That way, you're still seeing a larger paycheck, but you're also upping your retirement savings."
e4x6a3f;BariumEnema;1535413266.0;"Which country are you a citizen of?"
e4xo3zy;TypicalCupcake;1535428745.0;"Basically 20k is at 6.0% (unsubsidized). The remaining balance is at 3-4.5% (subsidized). So the balance of 27k is subsidized for the time being. "
e4xob91;TypicalCupcake;1535428914.0;"Thanks. Why do suggest maxing the Roth before an increase to the traditional? Also the robo profile suggested the 60/40. Perhaps 80/20 makes more sense. It is a taxable account. "

e4xpi0e;JimBoonie69;1535429878.0;"just a guess but the ROTH you can only contribute like 5k a year so, for some, it might make sense to save that up first and get it done with."
e4xqd3d;YesThisIsBare;1535430591.0;"The Roth is tax-advantaged space, the robo account isn't. You're better off getting as much of your money as possible into tax-advantaged accounts, and hitting the $5,500 annual contribution limit on an IRA shouldn't be too difficult in your situation."

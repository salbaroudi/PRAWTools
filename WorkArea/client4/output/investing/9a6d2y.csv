9a6d2y;TheInsights8;1535228150.0;"Does this rule apply to short selling indices (e.g., s&p 500) or CFDs as well?"

e4tnx5d;maz-o;1535253050.0;"well if you think about it, it shouldn't be capital gains because the profit you make doesn't come from capital gains."

e4tp79k;miketeeeveee;1535254370.0;"As it should be."
e4tuof7;ElectricLetuceHead;1535259926.0;"As a Canadian, if you want to get around that, the most tax effective way to short something I can think of would be put options in your TFSA. Get around the no trading rule by saying your just buying protection."

e4tte7a;roygbivy;1535258597.0;"Also, hyper trading in the Canadian version of an IRA is taxed if you accrue too much gain in the account. You literally get fined if you trade too much and make a lot of gains in your retirement account.Https://m.wealthprofessional.ca/market-talk/how-the-taxman-takes-more-from-tfsa-stock-trades-227508.aspx"
e4tyzrh;GaiusPompeius;1535264314.0;"I may be missing something, but isn't it the same in the United States?  Profits from short sales have to come from positions of less than one calendar year, which means they count as "short term capital gains", which are taxed the same as ordinary income at the federal level."
e4vc3aj;EVERGREEN13;1535331646.0;"Good idea.....Short Selling is an anti-investment."
e4trc99;The_Collector4;1535256536.0;"Gotta fund that "free" health care somehow"
e4tulfu;StacksOnStacksOnStax;1535259839.0;"I agree with you and would like to add to your argument.​Selling short should also be a capital gain, otherwise it would led to market inefficiency.  Lets say there is a 50/50 chance stock goes up or down.  If it goes up, then your gains are taxed at 10%, but if it goes down your gains are taxed at 40%.  Thus, the weighted-outcome of the event is not 50/50 and gives less incentive to short vs. go long."
e4tq67c;Ga5zilla;1535255363.0;"Try and short it and come back"
e4uuowf;GoingforIvey;1535308815.0;"You need a margin account to short, and a TFSA can’t be a margin account. "
e4uupfe;GoingforIvey;1535308850.0;"Yeah, better to use your TFSA for the long-hold type investments. "

e4txl5z;ShillForSoros;1535262898.0;"Canada’s right. Gains from short selling aren’t capital gains, so they shouldn’t be taxed like them. Go take your agenda elsewhere."
e4u36pn;jmlinden7;1535268873.0;"The tax system is deliberately set up to favor long positions"
e4tvkwv;maz-o;1535260866.0;"the tax system isn't built to give an even weight on the different types of stock trading. your assets aren't going up in value, thus shorting isn't capital gains."
e4u9cq1;SophistSophisticated;1535275464.0;"The maximum gain in long are infinite. The maximum gain in short are less than 100%.The weighted outcome isn’t 50/50 even without it being taxed differently.This isn’t market inefficiency. It simply the nature of going long vs short."
e4u6009;phil-e-donuts;1535271960.0;"Been shorting since January. "
e4udkpt;MikeXBT;1535280005.0;">Try and short it and come backPlenty of us have been shorting it all year, no "trying" involved. Not sure what you're trying to get at. "
e4uz376;ElectricLetuceHead;1535317092.0;"And that’s why I said use options, you can own long put option within your TFSA which give you the ability to profit on price decline tax free"
e4u453p;StacksOnStacksOnStax;1535269900.0;"Wither or not having a tax system set up to favor longs was deliberate or by accident doesn't really matter.  Its stupid because it artificially skews the market to long positions thus creating financial bubbles."
e4tw2ol;StacksOnStacksOnStax;1535261374.0;"What is the tax system built on?   But more to the point, laws which change incentives, which may lead to market inefficiency is not good.  In all honestly, these incentives to "go long" likely lead to more frequent financial bubbles."
e4u83d8;Ga5zilla;1535274137.0;"Selling your supply? "
e4vnz9a;GoingforIvey;1535343152.0;"Sorry, misread!"
e4ujdte;Walden_Walkabout;1535286927.0;"It would not be the only example of a tax incentive for long positions. Long term capital gains for instance. The purpose being that it reduces volatility. I believe that disincentivizing short positions would likely have a similar outcome. "

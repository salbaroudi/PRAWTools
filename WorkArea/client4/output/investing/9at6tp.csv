9at6tp;LegendaryHammy;1535435727.0;Chase’s new “You Invest” trading platform is up and running. Applications opened today.
9at6tp;LegendaryHammy;1535435727.0;"As a Chase customer, I signed up for the simplicity and plan to transfer over my stocks I have held in my Robinhood account once my new You Invest Account gets approved. I’m looking forward to seeing how good their research tools are. Excited to see what JPM can do to the retail investing space."

e4y2bwq;alucarddrol;1535441839.0;"Any fees?"
e4y47k6;FabulousExplorer;1535443805.0;"What are the advantages when RH, WB are free with options, AH and more..."
e4ydzfu;Oscote_;1535454028.0;"More details if anyone wants: http://www.mymoneyblog.com/chase-you-invest-free-stock-trades.html"
e4yuj6n;_NotWrongJustAsshole;1535482633.0;"I've been looking forward to this and signed up right away, even though I know waiting is probably the better play as they will surely offer a $100+ bonus to signup later.Then I saw they charge $75 for an account transfer. Even a partial transfer. Fuck that noise. It's a near-certainty I'll have to pay that eventually, or leave some stock there to avoid it. Even Merrill Edge only charges $50 for an account closure with free partial transfers. "
e4z3kz3;StrngBrew;1535493841.0;"I wouldn't transfer your stocks. There's really no reason to. Just start trading on the new platform and leave your holdings at RH there."
e4y3d9l;Delta_Dash;1535442937.0;"100 free trades per year, $2.95 per trade after"
e4yujy5;_NotWrongJustAsshole;1535482675.0;"$75 for a partial or full account transfer......."
e4y50sf;LegendaryHammy;1535444642.0;"The only knock I have against Robinhood is their inferior research tools. Otherwise I have had no issues with them."
e4yumrg;_NotWrongJustAsshole;1535482813.0;"IRA's, free checking + easy to move money back and forth, and peace of mind if you feel safer with Chase vs Robinhood. "
e4z4nf2;pitterposter;1535494846.0;"Why is it a near certainty? If you move to another brokerage they will most likely reimburse the fee if you ask. Or if you stop trading and sell your stocks the fee doesn’t apply to simply cash out the account and close it. "
e4z3muq;StrngBrew;1535493891.0;"But why ever do an account transfer? "
e4y53b4;LegendaryHammy;1535444714.0;"Yea and if you keep 15k in account you get 100 free trades every calendar year. "
e4ydt7o;Oscote_;1535453840.0;"I've always wanted a DRIP"
e4zvu3a;_NotWrongJustAsshole;1535518099.0;"Good point on the reimbursement. I remembered not paying the fee in the past but that was why, not because it was free."
e4zvngv;_NotWrongJustAsshole;1535517944.0;"The same reason I’d transfer into Chase: another broker offers better services. In the case of this product, it’s brand new and they may neglect it, make it worse or fall behind the market. I don’t want to be stuck paying that fee if so."
e4yz1np;Walden_Walkabout;1535489072.0;"Shit, I might quit Robinhood. I only have my play money in there, but I'd rather keep it with Chase and not risk having to deal with RH customer service."
e4ydsfd;Oscote_;1535453815.0;"So with 15k in the account, 200 free trades a year? Or is the 100 free only for those with 15k?does value of the portfolio count? "
e4yy28b;pitterposter;1535487884.0;"You need $15,000 in assets at the bank and a Chase premier plus checking account. Which the fee is waived with greater than $15,000 in assets at the bank. Unlike Bank of America which locks you into their reward tier for 15 months, it looks like chase bases it on the checking account you have. So if you drop below the $15,000 at any time you may have to pay the monthly checking account fee. "
e4zwibd;StrngBrew;1535518669.0;"I guess my point is, I plan to do new trading over on Chase but I'll just leave my existing holdings sitting in my old brokerage account and fund the new account with cash. It's free to leave stuff sitting there.If I sell them, I'll sell them from there. At this point it's only likely that the commissions will go down at the old account anyway."
e4ydyxv;Oscote_;1535454013.0;"100 free first year, 100 free after that for accounts with over 15k capital / investment value. Source: http://www.mymoneyblog.com/chase-you-invest-free-stock-trades.html"
e4z01rq;LegendaryHammy;1535490201.0;"Yes, but that is if you are a chase checking account customer. You have the ability to fund the You Invest account from a non-chase account."
e4zy8tj;_NotWrongJustAsshole;1535520164.0;"Sounds fine for you then. I buy and hold long term, so if I liquidated it would just be to buy the same stocks back at a new broker. Which would cause me to owe taxes, be out of my positions, and have to do work. None of which I like."
e4z1644;pitterposter;1535491390.0;"Correct, you can open and fund the you invest account by itself. But the terms clearly state to get 100 free trades after the first year you need to be a chase premier plus checking account holder. "
e4zzh5k;StrngBrew;1535521243.0;"Perhaps you are missing my point. I also only buy and hold long term. So I am happy to leave my current holdings sitting in my etrade account for as long as I plan on holding them and sell them from there if and when I want to do that. In the meantime, new buying will be done over on Chase. No account transfers, no extra taxes no nothing. "

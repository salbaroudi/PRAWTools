9aqzc0;manlymatt83;1535419941.0;"My rebalancing schedule is once per year in my taxable. However, with the recent jump in AMD, I'm up 80% and sitting on a huge gain. I'm trying to decide if I should rebalance back down and lock in the gain + short term capital gains tax (which is my preference -- no interest in being greedy), or hold the full year and lock in the long-term capital gains tax + consistent rebalancing schedule.Any thoughts on this? I didn't expect such a one-off jump."

e4xjqr3;hokageace;1535425072.0;"I don't believe in rebalancing. I believe in selling when my reasons for buying have changed. If you meant AMD to be a long term buy then there is no reason to sell. If not, you sell when you think you made your moneyTo me rebalancing is cutting your winners short which makes no sense. "
e4xget4;ja1484;1535422071.0;"There's a lot of conflicting research; some of it suggests rebalancing doesn't really matter in the long run. Most people, though, have preset triggers such as every X months or if asset allocation is Y% or more off.There's nothing wrong with rebalancing because one of your holdings rocketed up lately. Me personally, I rebalance every 6 mo and just leave it at that."

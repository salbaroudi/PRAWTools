There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer* How old are you?* Are you employed/making income? How much?* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?* Any big debts?* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research.

I get how this affects your prices when buying and selling, especially in comparison to a broker like Fidelity who is known for giving you great order flow, and especially if you're using a market order instead of a limit order.My question is, what kind of volume do you need to be trading for this difference to be greater than $5?

However I need several other opinions to base my decision making on. Let's say I want to invest 80/20 stocks/bonds. Would I just put all of my stocks into that mutual fund?

I would like to invest the 10k into the stock market and grow it over the next 3-5 years (maybe more im not 100% sure) . My risk tolerance is average i would say, some risk but not too much. I will have no outstanding debts to pay off after school. Any advice on how I can grow and invest this money would be welcomed."

e4z5ybd;throwawayinvestacct;1535496048.0;"Puts and calls are riskier plays that give you easy access to leverage. With options, you're buying just what the name implies: an *option* to buy the stock at a particular price in the future. This is cheaper than actually buying the shares. As a result, your gains (if any) multiply, but you're buying nothing of permanent substance with your premium, so your losses are more total/complete if you're wrong.Consider [this simple example from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/university/options/option2.asp):>With this in mind, let’s consider a hypothetical example. Let's say that on May 1, the stock price of Cory's Tequila Co. (CTQ) is $67 and the premium (cost) is $3.15 for a July 70 Call, which indicates that the expiration is the third Friday of July and the strike price is $70. The total price of the contract is $3.15 x 100 = $315. In reality, you'd also have to take commissions into account, but we'll ignore them for this example. On most U.S. exchanges, a stock option contract is the option to buy or sell 100 shares; that's why you must multiply the contract by 100 to get the total price. The strike price of $70 means that the stock price must rise above $70 before the call option is worth anything; furthermore, because the contract is $3.15 per share, the break-even price would be $73.15.>Three weeks later the stock price is $78. The options contract has increased along with the stock price and is now worth $8.25 x 100 = $825. Subtract what you paid for the contract, and your profit is ($8.25 - $3.15) x 100 = $510. You almost doubled our money in just three weeks! You could sell your options, which is called "closing your position," and take your profits – unless, of course, you think the stock price will continue to rise. For the sake of this example, let's say we let it ride.>By the expiration date, the price of CTQ drops down to $62. Because this is less than our $70 strike price and there is no time left, the option contract is worthless. We are now down by the original premium cost of $315.If you'd spent that hypothetical $315 on CTQ stock on 5/1 rather than the call, you'd have bought roughly 4.7 shares (let's ignore the whole fractional share bit for now). Three weeks later when the price hits $78 (at which time you'd have made $510, or more than 100% on your call contract) your 4.7 shares are worth about $367 (a much smaller gain). Thus, if the option-holder sold at that point, they'd have made *way* more money off of their $315 investment than Mr. Share Buyer. However, if the option holder held on until that expiration date (at which point the price had fallen to $62) their call is worthless, but your shares are still worth 4.7 x 62 = ~$291. Realistically/hopefully, the call holder would sell to close for a few pennies in advance of actually exercising, but the point remains the same."

Twenty years ago, "We're going to sell books and lose money and hope everyone else goes out of business first" looked like a pretty sketchy business model, and it looked worse when the dot-com crash happened. If you buy a company, the most you can lose is what you invested. If you short sold Amazon at $60 in January 2000, it would have gone to $30 by July and you could have made 50% on your money. Or you could have held onto it for another 18 years and it would have gone to $1900 and you would have lost THIRTY TIMES your investment. "

e4zb44p;throwawayinvestacct;1535500590.0;"What you're describing is whether to make "traditional" or "Roth" 401k contributions. The idea is similar to the Roth IRA you mention at the end (definitely a good idea over a brokerage account, assuming you're saving that money for retirement).A "traditional" contribution (whether 401k or IRA) is made with pre-tax dollars. In a 401k, this is accomplished by taking it out of your paycheck before collecting taxes, in an IRA it's done with a tax deduction to true you up. Either way, you're contributing money you haven't paid taxes on yet. The trade-off is you are taxed on your eventual withdrawals from that account in retirement as ordinary income. "Roth" contributions you make with post-tax money (money you've paid taxes on in present day). In exchange, withdrawals from a Roth account are *untaxed* in retirement.At bottom, it's a question of tax rate arbitrage. If your tax rates are identical going in and going out, there is no difference between a traditional and Roth. For example, assuming a 10% tax rate (to make the math easy):* $1000 pre-tax today, gaining 7% annually for 30 years is $7,612.26. Less 10% taxes ($761.23) upon withdrawal = ***$6,851.03**** $1000 pre-tax, less 10% taxes today = $900. $900, gaining 7% annually for 30 years is ***$6,851.03***If you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement than it is now, you're better off with the traditional contribution. If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement than it is now, you're better off with the Roth. There are [income limits than can affect your Roth-vs-traditional](https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/contribution-limits-deadlines) ***IRA*** choices, but not for 401ks, so the tax rate arbitrage is the really relevant question.No one can predict the future, so it's all a bit of a guessing game. However, there are some broad assumptions that I (and some others) often make:* If you're young, you're (hopefully) going to increase your earning potential over time. Thus, to the extent you're ever going to make Roth contributions, you're probably better off (not knowing if rates will increase/decrease over time, which could disrupt this assumption) doing so early in your career. This favors Roth.* US effective tax rates are at [historic lows](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/11/your-taxes-are-really-low-in-one-chart/?utm_term=.632e6a27923a) (that's a 2014 story/graph and they've only been lowered further since). Absent a really incredible reimagining of what government does, it requires a certain minimum amount of money to function. Given that, at least to me, it seems more likely that tax rates will be the same or higher in 30+ years than that they will be even lower. This favors Roth.* Older folks tend to spend less in retirement. [According to a 2016 study](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/retirement/2018/05/31/what-does-an-average-retirement-cost/35455427/), about $1k less a month. This can be tied to many things (hopefully lower housing costs as your home is mostly/totally paid off, no kid-related expenses, lower transportation costs, not saving for retirement anymore, etc, etc). As a general matter, assuming a progressive tax code, spending less means you need to withdraw less to get by, which means you can subsist on a lower income. This gives you a greater potential to be in a lower top bracket among whatever brackets exist in the future, and have a lower overall tax rate as a result. This would potentially favor traditional contributions.Personally, I do traditional 401k and Roth IRA. This is a bit a product of stasis/rigidity and not totally careful planning: I started with a traditional 401k and haven't wanted/bothered to change, while I opened the Roth IRA more recently. However, [there's also an argument to be had for such a mix](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/10/pf/401k-vs-roth-retirement-accounts/index.html). In retirement, you will (one hopes) have some baseline chunk of Social Security, and you're then left to fill-in any remaining chunk to get you up to the annual $ figure you need to live the life you want. If your retirement funds are all traditional or Roth, you've ceded away control over your taxes. If it's all traditional, you're in whatever tax bracket that leaves you in, and if it's all Roth, you'd better hope rates are higher or else you threw away money in the past. By having a mix, you can better manage your taxes in retirement."

e4ww9vi;whrthwldthngsg;1535403311.0;"I mean, you can. But there is no scenario I can think of in which doing so would be wise. Tax deductions are worth the deduction * your marginal tax rate. Since marginal tax rates will always be less than 1, the value of the deduction is always less than the deduction itself. Think of it this way. If your marginal tax rate is 40% and you have a $1,000 deduction, the $1,000 deduction reduces your taxable income by $1,000, saving you $400 in taxes. If you intentionally lose $1,000 to earn $400 you have intentionally lost $600. "

In addition, you might buy in with 100 in September at a lower point and if the market recovers, you have better gains with those 100 invested in September. "

That debt will stick with you for a while unless you aggressively pay it back. Also 5.8% is also a high interest rate, which is close to the average return for the SP500.

After that, pay off at least the higher interest loans ASAP. You say "5.8% ***average*** interest", so I assume it's a range. For loans down at the lower end it may make sense to pay the minimum and invest the difference. However, once you start talking 5, 5.5, or even 6+%, it's better to pay down that debt ASAP, IMO.As to the specific rule you asked about, [I believe it is simply a permissible option for employers to offer](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/irs-ruling-allows-401k-student-loan-benefits-2018-08-27), not something you can independently do. It sounds like the IRS has essentially decided that employers can offer 401k matching based on your student debt repayment as opposed to your own 401k contributions. This is very nice, as young employees saddled with debt may be paying down that debt, unable/unwilling to contribute to their 401k and therefore losing the match. However, it sounds like this is just an employer option to offer it. If your employer offers, maybe that makes sense (i.e., put *all* your excess cash towards paying down very high interest student loan debt while still securing your match), but if not? I don't think you can do anything (could write a letter to HR, I guess, asking if they'd implement it)."

If you have a target date fund, you basically never ever have to sell (it autorebalances and adjusts as you age).Ignoring target dates and/or re-working your portfolio as you age, you can just find an asset mix that works, selling only to rebalance at certain points. Ideally, you'll have some preset rules (maybe rebalance once a year or when your asset mix is more than 5 or 10% off). E.g., my portfolio is essentially 60% US stock, 30% international stock, 10% US bonds, with a slight small/mid-cap tilt on the stock holdings (really very slight).

This will allow you to use all the cash and even can set up recurring deposits. For example let’s say buy $SPY today that would give you about 10 shares. But with the cost being close to $300 it would take you 30 weeks to buy one more share. M1 allows you to buy fractions with a minimum of $10. This gives you recurring buying power from day one, dollar cost averaging and seeing compound dividends twice before you could even buy your next share. That being said you don’t need to buy a bunch of stocks and make your own. A single pie with 1 ETF is fine or even to break up a little more with domestic and international at some ratio.

For instance, CT is expensive as hell and if I moved somewhere cheaper the withdrawal taxes would be less, or is it a federally determined bracket?There is no "withdrawal tax", the withdrawals (from a traditional 401k/IRA) are taxed as ordinary income. The reason retirement living expenses relate to your tax bracket in retirement is you somewhat self-determine your income in retirement, based on what you withdraw from your portfolio (after Social Security). Given that, the answer to your question is sort of yes. First, there are state income taxes to consider. If you're living in a high-tax state now and planning to move to a lower tax state in retirement? That's another point in favor of traditional (as traditional contributions avoid those state taxes now on the expectation of having no/lesser state tax obligations upon withdrawal in retirement). If you're planning on staying in CT, though, then that's just another level of tax rate guessing to consider (will your *state* tax rate be higher or lower in retirement?). Additionally, cost of living matters for the same general reason all retirement expenses matter for tax considerations. If you plan on living in a higher CoL state in retirement, you'll be withdrawing more to live your life (or vice versa if planning to move from CT to a lower CoL state). You can't know what the brackets will be 30-40 years from now, but (assuming progressive taxation remains, which seems likely) withdrawing more means you're more likely to hit a higher tax bracket (whatever those brackets end up looking like) and a higher effective rate as a result. Thus, the more expensive a state you'll be living in in retirement, the more you'll be withdrawing and (therefore) the more taxes you'll end up owing on those withdrawals (if they're from traditional accounts). That could favor Roth."

e4z4z8w;throwawayinvestacct;1535495152.0;"I 100% echo SoJ's point. Absent a serious investment of time (and more time to gain knowledge), your safest bet as a retail investor is likely a few broad index funds like VTI/VXUS/BND (or VGIT). Even paid professionals have a very difficult time maintaining market-beating performance by any significant margin over the long haul.SoJ already gave essentially the same response I give to these game posts (I know you said there's not real prize, but to repeat). If it's all or nothing (first place is a Cadillac El Dorado, second place is a set of steak knives, third place is you're fired) then bet on some heavily leveraged ETF that multiplies gains and losses (like the UPRO or TQQQ examples he gave). And if it's gradual, I'd say use the same general index fund investing that is the best path for most retail investors."
e4x3k21;throwawayinvestacct;1535410791.0;"VGTSX is one of your better holdings, IMO. Do you have specific, market-beating information upon which to bet that the US economy will outperform the non-US global economy? If no, you should be diversified into international holdings. And past performance is not an indicator of future returns.To reiterate, the number of funds doesn't matter (though it can make it more complicated to rebalance). However, your current holdings do not appear to evidence any particular strategy, it's just a mish-mash of random funds, spread across a bunch of accounts for no apparent reason. Pick an asset mix and go with that.You're in your 30s? Use VFIFX (Vanguard's 2050 target date) as a baseline. Honestly, you could just buy that and be done. However, to get more specific, it's 90/10 stocks/bonds. Even more specifically, it is roughly 55% US stock, 35% international stock, 10% bonds (7% US bonds, 3% int'l bonds, but whatever).So, an easy baseline to measure against would be (I'm assuming all but the Schwab account are with Vanguard, given the predominantly Vanguard funds):* 55% VTSMX* 35% VGTSX* 10% VBMFXIn each account (shuttering the Schwab account, moving the money over). And I say baseline because I mean it: if you want to deviate for some reason, do it, but this gives you a place to start. Want a mid-cap tilt (as you seem to want, given your mid-cap fund holdings)? Replace some of the VTSMX with VIMSX (maybe 5-10%). Want a dividend tilt (don't know why, but you have several dividend funds)? Do the same with a dividend fund. Want to be more aggressive (as you indicate above)? You could cut out the bonds to buy more stock (I wouldn't, but up to you). Etc, etc."

e4x0g4u;throwawayinvestacct;1535407812.0;">Ah, gotcha. So if I wait until I hit my retirement goal, say $1 million, I'll be paying taxes on that if I withdraw it all at once.One generally doesn't withdraw a retirement account all at once, come retirement. The goal is (usually) to build up a big enough nut that you can then slowly live off of distributions from that account (as opposed to a salary).>So if I withdraw, say $10,000 per month out of the $1 million, I'll be paying taxes on each withdraw as well as the selling fee of $6.95.If you were in just a single stock/fund, you'd be paying just a single $6.95 brokerage fee on the sale (to get that $10k cash to then withdraw). However, one usually holds multiple positions (unless you're in a target date retirement fund), so it'd probably be several sales (with several brokerage fees) to get you that $10k withdrawal (assuming you wanted to keep your portfolio allocation consistent). And while I know you're just using examples, it's worth remembering that $10k/month is $120k/year, which is a 12% "withdrawal rate" on a portfolio of $1m. That kind of withdrawal is [hugely unstable and likely to make your portfolio fail (go to zero) in retirement](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadepfau/2018/01/16/the-trinity-study-and-portfolio-success-rates-updated-to-2018/). More realistically, you'd probably be talking about $30-40k/year on $1m (or ~$3k/month).>So in terms of taxes, it's best to go with a retirement package? Roth or I think it's traditional. I know that one, you pay taxes upfront and the other you pay taxes when you withdraw.Some of the most common retirement accounts are 401ks and IRAs. Either can have "Roth" or "Traditional" varieties. 401ks have to be offered by your employer and we don't know if yours does, so let's stick to IRAs for now.For an IRA, you can deposit $5500 (assuming you've earned at least $5500) per year (increases a bit when you're older) and that money (and any gains) is restricted in various ways until you reach retirement. In exchange, you get the benefit of owing no taxes on trading within the account. Buy $100 of stock and sell it later for $200? In your regular brokerage account you'd owe taxes on the $100 gain, in an IRA you'd owe nothing (at least, until you start withdrawing in retirement, potentially).The Roth vs. Traditional decision is basically what you said. A traditional IRA, you fund the account with pre-tax dollars (thanks to a tax deduction for your contributions). However, withdrawals from a traditional IRA are taxable in retirement as ordinary income. A Roth you fund with regular, post-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Thus, with a traditional IRA you pay the taxes on the back-end, with a Roth you pay them on the front-end.>So what's a good use for the etrade account? I'm guessing I could rollover all my gains from etrade into a retirement account but I'd pay probably hefty taxes depending on the amount.You could sell some positions to fund an IRA, or you could just put new money you earn in.>What can I do with an etrade account, then? What is the benefit. Fun spending money, haha?Retirement accounts have deposit limits (401k $18.5k, IRA $5500, etc.). Moreover, retirement accounts usually lock up your money partially/entirely, such that you owe hefty penalties if you withdraw it before retirement. So, regular brokerage accounts are helpful (I) to save for retirement once you've reached your cap(s) in your retirement accounts and/or (II) for any other investment goal, where you want to access the money before ~ age 60."

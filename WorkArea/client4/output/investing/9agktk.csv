9agktk;monstimal;1535327991.0;What price will TSLA close at Monday?
9agktk;monstimal;1535327991.0;"Predict Monday's closing TSLA price after this weekend's obvious end to the 420 dream. Winner gets to win. I have no clue with this stock now, it's crazy. I'll guess $300."

e4va0mh;Hablamanos3;1535329659.0;"317.87"
e4v8oob;mwm5062;1535328298.0;"I can say with 100% certainty, it will be a number higher than $1. "
e4vf3ji;mutmonkey;1535334584.0;"I think it will open below 300, but finish the day around $310."
e4vfzgu;genericscotch;1535335458.0;"420,  Funding secured."
e4vrhu3;Obelix13;1535346528.0;"$314.16"
e4vu4oy;Mypronounsarexandand;1535349163.0;"Pi * 100"
e4w98ri;noloze;1535365499.0;"295"
e4wopry;G_Morgan;1535390505.0;"I think it'll go up over Monday. There seems to be a clear pattern at this point of the big boys profit taking before settling to let the greater fools "restore confidence". There is a huge rinse and repeat process going on that will continue until the greater fools grasp their status as greater fools. At that point it'll all go very south in quick order."
e4wowtj;local_braddah;1535390955.0;"$301, Bob"
e4v8uvh;EconomicHustle;1535328476.0;"Bloomberg is shitting on them as we speak. Who knows. If the SEC finds anything this thing will drop like a bag of bricks. "
e4v9jd5;userandaloser;1535329172.0;"Around $300 seems like a good guess"
e4vbx32;Col_John_Matrix;1535331485.0;"It will go up because TSLA doesn’t trade with any rhyme or reason."
e4vb9ol;oberlre02;1535330856.0;"it will start falling big if its a red day"
e4va03c;UgglaPujols;1535329645.0;"Only asking about Monday? I think it will drop further from Monday close. Just one opinion, who knows."
e4vg48j;bmwkbiker;1535335590.0;"I'm 100% that there will be no TSLA close on "Monday" Monday, September 3, 2018 is a holiday so the market will be closed."
e4vgg0s;Latteralus;1535335908.0;"Found the inside trader. "
e4xx9w3;monstimal;1535436719.0;"You are the big winner. You win a trip on the boring company's ohare express (expires 12-31-19)."
e4v9hs6;userandaloser;1535329126.0;"This isn't The Price Is Right"
e4vef9r;maz-o;1535333924.0;"while highly likely, you can't say with 100% certainty."
e4vhib3;lovedetroit;1535336949.0;"I agree. If you were in it Friday, you are probably all about Elon’s wild ride. I would be curious to see updated thoughts by investors/advisors after this month though. "
e4vnanl;SourceHouston;1535342499.0;"Nothing to do with sec for Monday, all about the staying public post at 11pm Friday night "
e4vp27r;jaug1;1535344171.0;"That’s not how Tesla stock works."
e4vbla4;monstimal;1535331166.0;"Yeah, to make the contest easy and because I am so confused how everyone didn't immediately recognize that tweet was full of shit. I could see it being flat Monday because everybody already knew. But I guess it will fall now on speculation of SEC action? I don't know, I just find this saga interesting."
e4vgtmi;Ebolinp;1535336284.0;"Are you from a week in the future?100% sure eh?"
e4vjl2a;missedthecue;1535338972.0;"Not how insider trading works..."

e4vai3g;mwm5062;1535330143.0;"No its not, but this stock doesn't make any damn sense usually so watch it go up or something "
e4vg4oy;wapiti_and_whiskey;1535335602.0;"Yeah he can it would get halted way before it traded to <$1 on monday"
e4vjxrf;Latteralus;1535339310.0;"Lol I understand that. Meant it as a joke."

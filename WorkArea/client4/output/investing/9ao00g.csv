9ao00g;Soberlaugh12;1535396756.0;"This is the [Rumor](https://www.livemint.com/Companies/SmFlYNnIlS0Mv76uBmm1SM/Warren-Buffett-set-to-pick-up-stake-in-Paytm.html)I don't get it, this doesn't seem like the deal they usually make, especially with the messed up structure they have. They have three different companies with three different owners housed in a holding company and one app.Paytm paymentsPaytm mall, Alibaba has a significant stake in this company. Paytm bank, which is owned by the holding company and the rest by the founder of paytm.(something like 40% on paytm bank is owned by the founder.)"

This is the explanation:>One of Berkshire’s key fund managers, Todd Combs, who is also seen as a potential chief investment officer at the company, is leading the transaction, the newspaper reported.Buffett brought the two new fund managers on to broaden Berkshires horizons. This would be an example of Combs doing that. Will be interesting to see what he does in the future."
e4x4a9u;cowsareverywhere;1535411470.0;"Paytm is absolutely huge in India, a country where millions do not use Banks at all and keep their money under mattresses. However, these millions do have access to a mobile phone. This absolutely does make sense for Berkshire and I would recommend reading more about their insane growth."
e4wxs6b;Santoshr93;1535405045.0;"Indian here, just got back from India after years away from home, paytm was just starting there when I left. I was really surprised to see paytm taking the role of venmo apple pay and PayPal ag the same time there. It's being used as an official transaction app in most of the local places I went (luxury and semi luxury brands don't yet take it as a parent mode). It's acting like the Chinese wechat payment method in most places. It has integrated almost every monthly bills to its app including gas electricity telephone TV internet insurance, basically anything you can think off. And they just started an e-bank. And to add to it, there literally seems to be zero competition to them right now! I would definetly invest in them if they get private. "
e4wu192;dvdmovie1;1535400386.0;"Softbank has a significant stake, as well."
e4wxx3c;stoikrus1;1535405191.0;"This is a very unlikely Berkshire deal even if it's lead by Combs. Paytm is a money pit that has already burnt through $2bn of capital in the last 3-4 years and it still faces stiff competition from WhatsApp and Google's wallet. Even the Indian government has not shown any favorable terms to Paytm in recent times. Instead it allowed WhatsApp to gain backdoor entry into the payments business. If Berkshire sees Paytm as a channel to sell insurance and other financial products, there are better assets to invest in India eg. HDFC Bank or Kotak Bank.Anyway, it will be a long, long road for Paytm to generate any kind of shareholder returns, if at all. "
e4xc2h4;Wheelio;1535418348.0;"I've been following Paytm lightly for a while and this news doesn't seem that surprising, India's economy is one of the world's largest and fastest growing yet it is still very reliant on cash. I don't have exact numbers or sources just right now, but unlike in the U.S. and so many other developed nations credit banking isn't as big and cash transactions still dominate, so an electronic payment system has *a lot* of room for growth and development. "
e4xijug;vineetr;1535423997.0;"> They have three different companies with three different owners housed in a holding company and one app.This is done to comply with various regulations in India. I'll reproduce [an image](https://imgur.com/K6wpROw) from [an article in the Indian mag The Ken](https://the-ken.com/story/loophole-games/) (credits to the mag for having done the original research; the article is behind a paywall), which shows the current corp structure. The structure is setup to ensure the parent company controls every holding. As the entire group diversifies into various fields, different companies are setup, some to comply with regulations (like in banking and financial services) and some to implement a firewall between companies."

e4wt1wy;Soberlaugh12;1535398934.0;"Yep. The size of the deal(350 M)should have tipped me off. I think Paytm is the company which has the potential to grow into a company worth 50+B dollars if it can withstand the challenge of Facebook for two- three years.     Facebook will be Rolling out payments in Whatsapp to the public this year. WhatsApp has a captive audience of 200M users. They can spend less money than Paytm but scale faster. It will be great to watch. I think if Facebook can execute WhatsApp payments roll out successful. WhatsApp will become another extraordinary acquisition for Facebook."
e4xoy5q;mn_sunny;1535429434.0;"Honestly figured this would've been a Weschler or even Munger play before Combs. Combs must have a lot more free-time now since they've appointed the CEO for the AMZN/JPM/BRK joint venture."

He's never invested in currency because currency as an asset class doesn't produce anything. He's stood against investing in gold for his entire investing career. Now take currency, which he's never cared for investing in, and make it digital, which he's never really cared to invest in, and you get a hard no from him. "

e4z8k32;flannel_jackson;1535498373.0;"" We're trying to create an end-to-end financial exchange, an airport. Whereas, Paytm is a pure -- is a B2C operation, where they want to make a few percentage points out of every  transaction that you do today in the market in terms of using your e-wallet. So I think companies like Paytm are going to be very threatened when WhatsApp comes in and launches their e-wallet or when Amazon comes in and launches their e-wallet, these are all real threats like Google Pay's have come in India and so on. It doesn't matter to us because our business model is so integrated and so key to the various facets of India's financial industry that it doesn't impact us how people use it. For example, Paytm is also our partner in -- for Centrum for foreign exchange. So we don't really see them as competition. We see our activities as complementary to them in a way. And we want to be the airport who can work with virtually anybody, including Paytm."CEO Robin Raina of Ebix[https://www.ebix.com/pdf/EBIX-USQ\_Transcript\_2018-05-09.pdf](https://www.ebix.com/pdf/EBIX-USQ_Transcript_2018-05-09.pdf)"

e4x0w5m;waitbw;1535408259.0;"Indian here, WhatsApp will not be able to roll out payment in its current Avatar.Simply because there are certain security standards that a payment entity needs to follow in Indian market, like login everytime with a password.Who would use WhatsApp if you need to login everytime..that's the whole reason why WhatsApp is such a huge success, there were thousands of messaging  apps before WhatsApp.."
e4xoiq1;Jimoh8002;1535429090.0;"Paytm is going to have figure out how to do what Snap, Twitter, Vine and a long list of others couldn't do.

e4y4eyt;helper543;1535444019.0;"> The Indian government basically forced people into this.Weeks after the notes ban, Paytm had advertisements starring Modi, the prime minister.     NOrmally I would say "can you imagine a president endorsing a company", but then I remembered Trump.     I would stay away, as an election and government change could easily uncover some interesting company history, along with a new government endorsed competitor."

e4xx7of;trustno1111;1535436657.0;"Wow, you really don't understand bitcoin!  I can clear up your misconceptions though.1. Signed transactions are visible to the entire network within milliseconds.2.  The settlement time for a signed transaction is typically 10 min.3.  Compare the above to a typical credit card -- where a payment can be rescinded for months after the original purchase.  Or compare to an ACH transfer which at best takes 3 days to complete.  With bitcoin, after 10 minutes, the transaction is fully settled and cannot be rescinded.4.  With lightning network, the settlement time of a transaction is also measured in milliseconds.  There's no other payment network on the planet that can compete with this.5.  The cost of doing calculations is not a function of time, it's a function of how many miners are helping secure the network.  If there's a large number of miners, the calculation is very hard.  If miners decide to stop mining, the difficulty of the calculations actually decreases making it less costly.6.  The scarcity is guaranteed by fundamental mathematics.  There's no other known system in the universe that has the guaranteed scarcity bitcoin provides.I hope you learned something today!"

If there's only 1 miner in the world, it doesn't become easier to mine, it's simply less competition. The mining difficulty is set by the algorithm and the fact that the easy coins have been mined already.> The scarcity is guaranteed by fundamental mathematicsThe scarcity is designed in the algorithm. It's not a physical limitation. Satoshi set up the limit by design. He could have set another limit.> With bitcoin, after 10 minutes, the transaction is fully settled and cannot be rescinded.So cannot do chargeback or cancellation, unlike a real credit card."

9am3g3;Felr2;1535373774.0;Isn't stuff like Robinhood and /r/wallstreetbets the "shoeshine boys" in the famous quote by Kennedy?
9am3g3;Felr2;1535373774.0;""You know it's time to sell when shoeshine boys give you stock tips."The general public now sees the stock market as some kind of a game. It's now the "cool" and "fun" thing to do for millennials because if you just put in money into this market, it will spit more money out. It's the stock market mania. "

e4whn4p;spelunker;1535376167.0;"Maybe /r/investing are the shoeshine boysMaybe you're the shoeshine boy OP"
e4wiaio;Tomatotowers;1535377255.0;"Actually no. Most people at wallst bets are familiar with options and Greeks. I am willing to  bet most people here at r/investing don't know what an option is. The questions you see here range from " I have 10k what do I buy" or "when's the next market crash?" Both of these are useless questions no one knows the answer to, but people will pretend they do. At wsb, you'd get called a fag and get told to go back to MarketWatch."
e4wgrig;WeKnowAlot;1535374790.0;"WSB actually has tendies though. Robinhood provides them tendies on the cheap with free trading. They even offer margin for when you are tired of living in an apartment and want to upgrade to a yacht.Kennedy was the shoeshine boy. WSB is just a collective shkreli hivemind that knows how to win."

e4x5uw6;rawjj;1535412885.0;"Says the guy posting NEED HELP threads on r/investing "
e4wj9zj;stenlis;1535378998.0;"No. BTC has been through a shoeshine boy period, though."
e4whxtj;uFascistsBoundToLose;1535376657.0;"You caught us. &#x200B;Just let me know what you're dumping before you sell. "
e4wo2wn;G_Morgan;1535389057.0;"TBH there are actually some clever people on /r/wallstreetbets. They know what they are doing is stupid.They don't by and large believe MU is going to the moon."
e4wtgn3;doougle;1535399544.0;"The difference is that now the shoeshine boys comprise a larger percent of the overall market than before.  This is especially true in the option market."
e4yy1o4;FIinvestor;1535487864.0;"I don't think technology available to facilitate easy and cheap trading dictates overall market sentiment. If you combine all Robinhood accounts I doubt it is anything sizable relative to the overall market. The problems arise when the big institutional investors start to get the feeling of the market providing unlimited easy money.As for WSB, for every big win they take 5 big losses so I doubt too many of them consider it that easy money."
e4wkgkx;Donnie-Jon-Hates-You;1535381213.0;"Robinhood actually serves a purpose... I don't have the article handy, but basically they data mine their users stock buying behavior and front run it./r/WSBs is like the shoeshine boy who gives stock tips to the elevator operator who then tells the cleaning staff who then tell Mr. Kennedy."
e4wg93v;1800idgaf;1535374026.0;"This nickel apparently doesn’t want his free tendies "
e4wqcru;enginerd03;1535394099.0;"That would be illegal fyi"
e4wgpfx;VacationLover1;1535374702.0;"Quit trying to be ‘cool’ you crazy millennial. Stock markets aren’t a game where you put in money and get tendies in return.OP is on to you "
e4zm0z1;Black38;1535509849.0;"so is insider trading"
e4wqpb9;Donnie-Jon-Hates-You;1535394808.0;"It's not if you do it right... "
e4wh4be;1800idgaf;1535375331.0;"OP ain’t got shit on me. I’ve lost more to the stock market than OP makes in an entire year. And guess what, I can still afford chicken fingers because I’m a motherfuckin G. "
e4wjjb5;neocoff;1535379457.0;"You finger chickens? That is some weird fetish you got there boy."

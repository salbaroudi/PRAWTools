9a61ou;eelgnas;1535224286.0;"Would you consider this a diversified portfolio for long term? &#x200B;33% QQQ33% SPY33% DIA1% single stock pick&#x200B;If you know other ETF tickers that track these indexes better, let me know. "

e4t8wwe;fakerfakefakerson;1535238121.0;"Oh yeah super diversified...Unless of course you’re looking for exposure to mid cap equities, small cap equities, developed international, emerging markets, duration, credit, currency...or really any asset class other than just large cap US equity. But other than that you’re definitely covered by buying three funds that have a correlation of about .98"
e4t4aa4;kiwimancy;1535232894.0;"SPY is as diversified as QQQ+SPY+DIA. None have international stocks, so if you want that, you're not fully diversified."
e4szlxr;xertrez;1535225732.0;"If you want diversified with an overweight to tech/financials, do 67% $VTI and 33% $QQQ.  This also gives you small/medium cap exposure outside of tech/financials."
e4tc388;coffeenick;1535241359.0;"No, I would not consider that a diversified portfolio.  You need to add some small and medium cap, as well as international stocks if you want."
e4t04z6;genericscotch;1535226712.0;"Way too much tech"
e4t4fo6;eelgnas;1535233083.0;"I want to be diversified but be a little heavier in tech, how are you diversifying if you don't mind me asking"
e4tx3bt;dirtee_1;1535262408.0;"> None have international stocks, so if you want that, you're not fully diversified.Not true. QQQ has JD.com and Baidu."

e4t11lv;eelgnas;1535228278.0;"How is NASDAQ, S&P and DOW "too much tech" if that's the case it's just the way of the world now. "
e4t4nj4;kiwimancy;1535233362.0;"With international stock funds, bond funds, HY bond funds. Currently no commodities or EMN funds."
e4t1ph2;genericscotch;1535229329.0;"SPY is already weighted heavy with tech, why add QQQ?  What diversification benefit do you see in adding DIA and QQQ as opposed to putting it all in SPY or a total market index?"
e4t1u5g;eelgnas;1535229533.0;"You're saying I'm not diversified enough but suggesting 100% of holdings into SPYa total market index is for pussies and old people.. I'm 23.Appreciate your input though, really just looking to see the investing mindset of others "
e4t1xmn;genericscotch;1535229683.0;"Diversification is for pussies and old people too."

e4t23g4;eelgnas;1535229916.0;"So your idea of diversification is 100% S&P 500 LOL"
e4t2bnt;genericscotch;1535230241.0;"No, I am wondering how adding the other two funds helps you in terms of diversifying, given that it increases your exposure to tech."
e4t2lhw;eelgnas;1535230637.0;"I feel like the weight of tech in S&P and DOW are balanced enough. As for NASDAQ you have me there, I just like tech stocks. Also holding some CGC for when pot is legalized in Canada in October. Other than that, what else is there? "
e4t2lmc;Agrees_withyou;1535230642.0;"I agree."

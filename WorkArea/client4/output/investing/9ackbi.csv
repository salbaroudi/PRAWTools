9ackbi;MedicalLabScientist;1535281637.0;"Wow, this is crazy.On the old Vanguard website there was a pull down menu under Transfer money and there was an option "Transfer to or from bank account"This would let me send money from my settlement account to my chase checking or vice versa.Now when I pull down the Transfer money on the new website this option is missing and can't find it anywhere.Can anyone help me?"

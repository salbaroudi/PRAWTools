e4x2lba;rebelde_sin_causa;1535409892.0;"I think if you're willing to hang in with it for 10 years it's a great buy at this price, but I can't tell you if you will get a better price anytime soon. Maybe so, maybe not. I bought most of my shares last year when it was $14-$15. If it gets down there again I will add more, but I'm not in a hurry. Anyhow, for TEVA longs, nothing that has happened in the last few days or weeks qualifies as "going down.""
e4x5ncx;calculman3829;1535412693.0;"I looked at TEVA and they're in the process for a turnaround. Buffet's purchase is relevant for the long term.What I'm trying to understand here is the moat. They make generics and other drugs, and it's a hamster wheel where they have to keep going. It's not Coca Cola. "
e4ykkuu;ChekovsWorm;1535462567.0;"They're one of the generic pharma mfrs that got caught up in the valsartan impurities due to a [contaminated with carcinogen base ingredient everybody sourced from China](https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm613729.htm). Which has led to a worldwide near-ban on one of the best and most common blood pressure drugs. There are medical groups, HMOs and foreign equivalents, doctors, and hospitals forcing patients off valsartan due to this problem. (Including mine, dammit!) That's by no means the only generic they make, but it's a current global medical problem, and a reason to stay away from drugmakers that make valsartan, IMHO, until this mess is settled. Also you might want to look into any impact from the BDS movement given they are an Israeli company. Whatever you may think of the Boycott, Divest, Sanction movement, BDS is very definitely a market risk for any Israeli company. I'm not looking at the charts and numbers at all on this; I'll leave that to others who follow TEVA. Just pointing out two very real external factors that can affect the public perception of Teva and the actual marketability of its products. I have no problem taking TEVA pills (except my damn valsartan!) but I personally wouldn't invest in them right now."

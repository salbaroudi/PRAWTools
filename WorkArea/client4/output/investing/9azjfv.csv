9azjfv;rashad14;1535496492.0;"If you were to choose between index funds to invest, how would you go about evaluating them?For example, why S&P500 but not MSCI ACWI, or MSCI World?I assume you could approach this analysis from the overview of macro and geopolitical factors  and the outlook. Could also consider comparing ratios (P/E for example). Another way could be looking at some risk adjusted return of the indices.Any other quantitative/qualitative  techniques, suggestions? Please refer any paper/report that could be useful.thanks"

e4z91hw;Lostboy500;1535498798.0;"I think beyond financial ratios, it would simply come down to as you mentioned the view of the Global markets vs. domestic vs. developed vs. EM.  Why not choose a blend of all three using world and acwi EX-us so as not to have unintended overexposure to the US large cap."
e4z9p5v;atdharris;1535499372.0;"In general, it's best to have both a total market US ETF and then a non-US ETF. You can either buy all encompassing ETFs or go with multiple ones like an S&P 500/small/midcap, same with developed overseas markets/emerging markets. I don't analyse ETFs like I would individual companies because they are mostly diversified and I intend to old them without thinking as much long term. "

9a28dz;dnl_torio;1535181742.0;"So let's say there's a guy who wants to start investing. He has dabbled some with Robin Hood just to learn how to watch some of the trends of the stock market. Does not want to make $10k tomorrow on some random stock, but rather wants to invest in a long term slow and guaranteed return. What books, articles, documentary's, websites, and subreddits would you recommend one to read to gain the background knowledge needed to make an informed decision? "

Once you got that do your research on the companies growth and potential growth, if it looks good then invest in it. If there is one thing you can learn about the stock market is how to properly read the the charts, thats about it.

If you did this and made on avg 7%:Each dollar you invested would be worth:@45 years = 21 dollars@50 years = 29.46 dollars@55 years = 41.32 dollars@60 years = 57.96 dollarsAnd for shits and giggles, let’s say that Dave Ramsey is right and you earn 12 percent on average for 45 years:@45 years = 93.06 dollars"

It doesn’t matter how much money you’re going to invest! Start with small amounts that you can afford to lose. Learn from your mistakes and others’ mistakes. Increase your investment amount (stay away from leveraging)."

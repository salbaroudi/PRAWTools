9au441;wanderlust123123123;1535443279.0;Basic question -- how do dividends work? When do I receive the money? Does this ever effect the day on which you sell?
9au441;wanderlust123123123;1535443279.0;"Can you Boeing as an example? On which dates do I get the money?  I reinvest the money"

e4yd2qu;ScottishTrader;1535453029.0;"Here are the dates you will need to know for dividends.  These are all published.- Declaration Date: On quarterly dividends the company announces the amount and other dates, called the Declaration Date- Ex-Dividend Date: This is the date when those who buy the stock will NOT get the dividend, Ex, get it?-  Record Date: This is 2 trading days after the ex-dividend date when those who are on the record as owning the stock will get the dividend.  Effectively those who bought the stock prior to the ex-date.- Payable Date: This is the date when the dividend is paid.  It can be days or weeks, or even months, after the record date.  Some people reinvest the dividends which is called a DRIP, or dividend reinvestment plan.

e4yd5dt;Oscote_;1535453110.0;"I would recommend going to an actual website like investopedia or dividend.comBut: ex dividend date is the record date, so if you have bought shares of a stock and are "holding" those shares on that ex dividend date, you will receive a dividend. The payment date is usually weeks to a month later.Even are holding a stock on the ex dividend date, and sell the next day, you will receive a dividend on or around  the payment date. It is not uncommon for stocks drop slightly after ex dividend dates because of this. You might pick up a value, but you would have to wait up to 3 months to receive a dividend again.Most companies pay "quarterly" dividends, that is every quarter of the year (every 3 months). Some companies pay once a year dividends or monthly dividends.If you have more questions, I'll be happy to answer. Not a master but I have been a dividend investor for over 2 years now and have learned a bit. Best of luck! "
e4z0q84;potatochankun;1535490929.0;"I have another question. Is the company obligated to pay a certain dividend or can they choose not to?"
e4y4eaf;604FakeLove;1535444000.0;"Ex dividend date is August 8 for Boeing, so you get a dividend (lump sum of cash) on that date or around that time. This is taxable income and if applicable you may have withholdings depending on where you are from (if you're a foreign investor and not in US). You then report this income on your tax return. When you sell the share in the future dividends do not affect the cost basis of your shares. "
e4yee4n;emc87;1535454476.0;"You obviously know this, just clarifying for others:Ex date is trade date and is a convenience date. Record date is a settle date and what actually determines who gets the dividend. Ex date is the first trade date you don't get the dividendRecord date is the last settle date you do get itHence why in an X day settlement cycle, ex is T-(X-1) days from recordIf you did a short settle trade on ex date, you'd still receive the dividend"
e4yd72t;ScottishTrader;1535453161.0;"Sorry, here is all you need to know about BA from their website: http://investors.boeing.com/investors/stock-information/default.aspxScroll down to see dividend info."
e4z3gfa;IndianaGeoff;1535493718.0;"The company can do what it wants.  But some companies pay good dividends and will pay it reliably.  Occasionally you have companies that do a massive one time dividend.  Others pay a token dividend reliably.Any company in a cash crunch will look to cut back or end a dividend to keep solvent."
e4z4dgr;DallasRoommate13;1535494586.0;"The company can choose to lower/increase/maintain a dividend for whatever reasons it deems fit. Some companies, like ATT, have consistently increased their dividend on a yearly basis for decades while other companies, like GE, will probably eliminate their dividends in hopes of stabilizing their commitments. Companies/stocks with high yield typically have lower growth (most of the time negative growth) simply because they don't have enough profit to cover their commitments (high-yield REITs, or companies like Frontier).A lot of idiots see 10%-12% dividend yield and they think "wow that's a great source of easy money!" and while they do get a 12% yield from dividends, the stock will go down 15% in the same time frame. This is a loss, and typically not want you want to do. A dividend investor should look for value, not yield, when choosing mature companies to invest in."
e4y5f7q;hydrocyanide;1535445055.0;"The dividend gets paid September 7, also the ex date was August 9."
e4y4tfk;wanderlust123123123;1535444433.0;"Thanks. It's a Roth IRA. Can you just explain it simple? How many dividends per year? What's the amount? Does the stock tend to go up around that time because people are waiting to sell? Everyone gets the same dividend? "
e4ydjyo;Oscote_;1535453554.0;"This answer about ex dividend date appears wrong to me... I mean, I've only been dividend investing for 2 years, but it seems to have missed the mark a little"
e4y4gzf;604FakeLove;1535444078.0;"Note if your broker has a feature that reinvests the dividends into Boeing this would affect the cost basis of the shares."
e4y8ttn;radivoer;1535448591.0;"A 2 minute YouTube video could explain all the information you want.  They pay 4 times a year, not sure of the amount but I’m sure it’s probably around $1.50 a quarter. Stock usually goes down after the ex dividend date however much the dividend paid out is.  Everyone gets the same dividend per share amount so if you own 1 share you get $1.50 a quarter. If someone owns 10 shares he gets $15 a quarter (again, I don’t know the amount that was just a guess)"
e4y8yiz;aceman97;1535448729.0;"I’ll try to explain it:Normally dividends pay every 3 months. Some pay monthly. So 4 or 12 times a year.There is no normal amount. The company’s board of directors determine how much of a dividend you’ll get as a shareholder.The stock tends to go down by the amount of the dividend. If you have a stock which is currently trading at 5 dollars a share and they are going to pay out a 25 cent dividend, the price will come down by 25 cents or 4.75. However it will continue to trade and the price will either go up or down based on sentiment.You get 25 cents for each share that you own. If you have 4 shares, you will receive 1 dollar in dividends.  If you own 100 shares you get 25 dollars."
e4ydo57;Oscote_;1535453686.0;"I've never noticed stocks going down by the amount of the dividend... Do you have any proof or support evidence of this? "
e4ythn2;aceman97;1535480655.0;"It’s how dividends work. Dividends are not free money. Dividends are profits/debts that are being distributed to its shareholders. Once dividends are paid, there is an adjustment to the share price because the company took cash from its balance sheet to pay off shareholders or they borrowed the money. They no longer have that money or their debt increased, so the price/earnings of the company has changed and the price of the stock is adjusted accordingly."
e4yzpja;ur_all_nubs;1535489821.0;"To add to this:A stock is priced based on future earnings. Let’s say stock ABC will earn future cash flows that can be discounted to 100, and so the price is 100 for this stock. In addition to the future cash flows, you also have to pay for cash on hand. If ABC has 10 cash on hand, you’d pay 110 for this stock, but in reality the payment for the earnings is 100, and the 10 on top is just a swap of cash. If ABC pays a dividend of 5, then it has 5 cash on hand, but future earnings are still 100. Price now 105If a stock dosent go down by the same amount as the dividend, that means the market is revaluing the future cash flows portion of the stock, since this is uncertain. Cash on hand is not uncertain"

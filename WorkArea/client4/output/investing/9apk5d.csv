9apk5d;tellmetheworld;1535410229.0;Once you amass 1m in assets (investments, retirement, savings combined), how will you change your approach to investing if at all?

e4x3gfa;LCJonSnow;1535410698.0;"Why would I change what is clearly working, just because I hit a new digit in a base 10 numerical system?  &#x200B;I'll probably change it from my current allocation of assets, but that'll be a result of being older, not the dollar value."
e4x3r0y;NotMikeBrown;1535410971.0;"What you're asking is when to switch from a more aggressive growth strategy to a more conservative strategy.  It depends.  The change should be gradual and shouldn't be a either or.  As you approach your magic number you should be gradually getting more conservative.  Or don't.  To each their own."
e4y2exf;network_person_zippy;1535441928.0;"I feel like there's a lot of "out of my ass" posting here so far, so let me share with you the specifics of going 1m+ in assets.Current total NW is $1.89m. 28-35 years old.What \*ACTUALLY\* changes?* The Brokerage account you have the majority of your funds in will suddenly change. Friendly calls and passive emails about upgrading to a managed service and getting a financial second look.* If you are at 1m+ and under 45, it means you probably have, by now, 6 figures (entry or low) in a brokerage account if its not in multiple FDIC insured savings accounts #WhatIsFinancialEducation #LowRiskTolerace.* That means... your taxable income story changes. Suddenly you look to minimize and manage those pesky yields and dividends - hardcore.* You think about money not in 1's, 10's, 100's or even 1000's. Everything that is significant and requires mental accounting is 5 digit. A car is still a big expense. $3,000 for a small trip to Maui for a week doesn't even evoke the "I'll check my balance" syndrome.* You're less worried about inflows and more worried about outflows as it relates to investments.* Making a loss is, at a point, a loss harvest strategy, not a mental defeat.* Making a profit is entirely about finely tuning and executing, against your own emotions or "superior knowledge", a successful sell.* Most of your money is in passive indexes and mutual funds. This won't change until the 10m-30m+ mark, still too small of a fish to matter to anyone.* Your inflows, year by year, look smaller and less significant against your total NW. This triggers very subtle and sneaky bouts of lifestyle inflation that most people "starting" in the investing/FIRE circle would gaff at pre-500k and pre-1m.* You begin to way over-value your time, as if it's worth $1000 / hour.* You tell people "We're Comfortable" if the question of money or expenses ever come up.* Stress is less. Even if the market tanked 50%, you are still able to, with the right lifestyle adjustments, be completely fine.And finally.. and perhaps this last one is me projecting a little more than I'm used to doing...The Scarcity mindset is how most of us get to that point. Constant fear, pressure, challenges, obstacles, suffering, in some way, shape or form. But you "hustle" for so long and get your game and ego so fine tuned to it, that once you "make it", your life kind of loses its value. #QuarterLifeCrises #HalfLifeCrises"
e4xlsu5;FinanceGI;1535426822.0;"$1m mark doesn't really open yourself up to any new asset classes.At $10m, you can start investing in lower middle market PE/search funds for further diversification.  You may also have some access to hedge funds for further diversification as well.You could increase your risk tolerance as your base is larger but $1m isn't really enough to retire with...tl;dr: No changes."
e4x8gz0;dave8921;1535415220.0;"I was in my late 30's when my family hit $1m net worth.  After getting married, my wife and I decided to buy 90/10 stocks/bond until we got past $500k.  After $500k, I started working with a good bond trading desk and buying muni's rather than bond funds, moving more towards a 70/30 stocks/bond split (we are conservative and make a good annual income.)  In hindsight, that both helped and hurt because we didn't lose as much money in 08/09, but we never sold the bonds either.  We didn't have much cash outside our emegency fund to really buy at the lows other than our regular 401k/403b contributions and savings.  Liquidity was low in the markets as well so even good quality muni bonds were trading at haircut prices.  Cash was king and we held ours out of fear but luckily didn't sell either.  Today, we continue to buy to maintain that 70/30 stock/bond split."

e4xczuv;programmingguy;1535419165.0;"Depends on how close you are to various goals that are dependent on investments. Not a lot of changes to investing but probably on personal finance. Focus is more on wealth preservation when you are satisfied with whatever you have accumulate though income outside investments  also matters in the equation.Personally: * Fine with not beating the market while having 80% to 90% of financial assets in the market.* Increase weightage to defensive & safe dividend stocks at good prices.* Increase amounts to my t-bill weekly ladder for my emergency fund. Having more cash for dry powder/liquidity  on the sidelines is fine.   "

e4ycbis;brownck;1535452181.0;"The strategy I have with my 401k and my liquid savings is pretty different. I don't really do much with my 401k - just keep it in mostly S&P index funds. And looking forward I still wouldn't change much since retirement is long ways ahead. For the liquid part (I'm not anywhere near 1m in assets btw), I would probably invest more heavily in stocks since I would be more comfortable with the volatility. "
e4ytxhl;big_deal;1535481523.0;"I have, but my goals, financial needs, risk tolerance, and time horizon hasn't changed significantly so my allocation/approach is about the same."

e4x4xss;wirsteve;1535412063.0;"Depends on my age.I'm pretty young, and I have time to research stocks and manage a brokerage account, in addition to the IRA, 401k & 529 contributions that I have rolling.As I get older, have kids, my weekends aren't going to be as free to catch up on Bloomberg, CNBC, Value Line, etc. I'd be going to kids sporting events or whatever.NML or Baird have some great money managers, I might check them out. Depends on the fees of course."
e4x48uq;ff7fanfolife;1535411433.0;"I would probably dump 60% in bonds and the rest in a very safe investment like verizon or walmart. Then every penny i make after that dump it into a extremely risky high yield stock haha"

e4z5ui6;mililani;1535495951.0;"Just curious, how did you get that much money at your age?  "
e4xqsaa;LCJonSnow;1535430943.0;"End of the day, I plan on having more than $1M. So I'm still in growth mode.  As I get closer to retirement, I'll shift to less risk.  But that's happening because of advanced age, not because of the dollar value in the account.  If I'm 35 (pulling a number out of my ass), it doesn't make sense to invest $1M differently than $100k. If I won $100M in the lottery (that I don't play...), we'd be having a different discussion. That's truly life altering money.  $1M is an expectation along the journey."
e4xkw4x;Trapped_SCV;1535426075.0;"Risk management is kind of a funny notion.I remember reading in an old text book about risk management. One of the things they suggested was to favor safer sectors like finacial and large companies like Bear Stearns.Needless to say this ended up being the riskiest investment you could make in the mid 2000s because the companies had leveraged the purchase of subprime assets."

But I also want a family one day. I grew up in a household where my parents always worked and were never home. I never cared, in retrospect, about the "things" or "nice house" et. al  But I vividly remember when my mom and dad had the time once every few months to sit down with us and watch tv, or go out and do fun things as a family.  I would really, really hate to let who I am right now... to continue to be this person with kids. But without it, its just a lost feeling."
e4zlg7o;network_person_zippy;1535509368.0;"Oh yeah, and it kind of sucks at first to acknowledge. But I feel like, to be a complete and wholesome person, it's important to be introspective about these things, you know? Without constant re-evaluation of my own priorities, likes, dislikes, passions, hatreds, comfort, discomfort, etc. in life, that would mean I am being disingenuous to myself - about myself. That sounds like it would be a sad way to live."
e4zkyhp;network_person_zippy;1535508949.0;"Grew up on computers in the 90's. Did poorly (very) in high school. Didn't get past 2 quarters of community college (also did poorly). Interviewed for and got hired at a unusually prestigious tech company, helping internal "business units (ugh)" connect their networks to one another & to customers.   Turns out a lifetime of knowledge about systems, networks and security accumulated into adulthood is "the fast path to STEM" without needing a degree.That, and having a rising career in a field that was expanding like insanity post 2007-2009. Never cared much about pay, just about what are things people hate to do. Then, I do them, and do them better than anyone else.I feel like this is pretty much the generic meritocracy + good market conditions + luck story everyone shares. 50-80 hours a week, every week, for years. I just loved my work.Some old geezer told me at the height of the recession to invest every spare dollar into the market and live way below my means.

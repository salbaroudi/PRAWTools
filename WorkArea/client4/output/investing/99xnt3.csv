99xnt3;souporthallid;1535148143.0;CGC 4-for-1 split rumor? Looking for source
99xnt3;souporthallid;1535148143.0;"Saw it mentioned in a thread discussing Constellation investment into CGC. Anyone have source for split rumor? What might cause CGC to go for a split. Advantages and disadvantages?"

e4rglo0;SharksFan1;1535158603.0;"Their stock is only $45, seems odd that they would split it at that price."
e4r4nc9;sodenj5;1535148366.0;"They’ve already voted on and passed the decision to split the stock price. The reason is that they want to be more competitively priced with their direct competitors in APH and ACB. I believe it’s going to be a 3-1 split, but no one knows exactly when. "
e4umvoq;neve1064;1535292034.0;"I think splits help make buying in lots of 100 affordable for most traders.  Options drive the markets.  If your stock is too high, you may be locking yourself out of lots of action. "
e4s1b7r;808_Tanks;1535176694.0;"What happens to the options at play if this happens?"
e4r5nfv;HellaCrunchy;1535149296.0;"There are no disadvantages or advantages. It's going to be the exact same pizza, one has more slices than the other. "
e4r88qy;ChipmunkDJE;1535151569.0;"Is this also why CRON is skyrocketing? Just because it's in the same industry?"
e4ri81i;souporthallid;1535159944.0;"They may feel that a price is unattractive to investors because cannabis is still emerging and people are nervous about diving in. "
e4r7h41;doougle;1535150913.0;"I'm not informed on this topic but I really hope they aren't doing a split to "be more competitively priced with their direct competitors".  That would imply they're tying to attract uninformed investors."
e4r4q93;souporthallid;1535148441.0;"Nice. Source?"
e4s2fku;Progr4mmatic;1535177780.0;"Strike is divided and your options are multiplied. 9/28 45’s don’t let me down! "
e4r6ulc;ChazMan19;1535150369.0;"It will allow other investors to get in "
e4r6yvz;lubomeric;1535150475.0;"Always been curious about market activity before and after splits. When would you say is a better time to buy/sell, before or after the split "
e4rr5zs;ExternalManager;1535167523.0;"Just wondering, why doesn't a company like Berkshire Hathaway do this? Wouldn't they want more people to invest instead of making it so that you need to take out a mortgage just to purchase one share? "
e4r7a77;souporthallid;1535150746.0;"I understand the function of a split. I am strictly speaking the advantages to CGC to split. One answer I see is allowing other investors ability to get in at a lower price. The disadvantages are harder for me to comprehend, because you said, one large pizza is still the same unsliced as it is cut into 8 pieces.  "
e4rdw0f;sodenj5;1535156340.0;"Basically the entire sector has blown up once Constellation and Canopy announced their deal. Largely, the sector follows Canopy. As they go, so goes most of the cannabis stocks. "
e4r9yer;souporthallid;1535153036.0;"ACBFF up 8% as well. "
e4r9rts;le_cochon;1535152880.0;"Yes, 18% up today already too"
e4rnqbv;abandonplanetearth;1535164556.0;"I'm still learning so forgive my ignorance, but what does the price change?Whether you own 100 shares of CGC at $50 each, or if you own 200 shares at $25 each, shouldn't your gains and losses be exactly the same? 5% gain is 5% gain no matter the price, right?Unless I'm missing something obvious."
e4r9ldn;sodenj5;1535152727.0;"I mean that’s basically the purpose of any stock split. There’s no intrinsic change to the stock or market cap, it just looks more affordable/there’s a lower entry point for more investors. When Canopy is trading at $44/share vs Aphria which is at >$10/share it looks pretty lopsided. Split that 3-1 and suddenly Canopy is under 15/share. Looks a lot more attractive. "
e4r7qan;91143fd7dc4a5c4e7e74;1535151134.0;"Yeah. That's exactly what they want. They want to continue pumping their stock so they can cash out to fools willing to overpay."
e4rdqcc;dvdmovie1;1535156207.0;"> I really hope they aren't doing a split to "be more competitively priced with their direct competitors".I'll agree that that's a terrible reason if that's the actual reason."
e4r4t11;sodenj5;1535148513.0;"https://www.newcannabisventures.com/canopy-growth-gets-green-light-on-stock-split-and-acquisition/Approved for 2-1 or 3-1. 4-1 is not a thing. "
e4r7d5w;souporthallid;1535150818.0;"Certainly depends on the stock. I think CGC would have room to run after a split. I think getting in before could be advantageous if the stock price continues to soar upward after the split. "
e4s0v2m;RedditGuy1000;1535176257.0;"BECAUSE they dont want stupid investors to buy their shares"
e4u4oxm;samyosemite;1535270504.0;"They did with Class B shares."
e4rewbt;Meadhead81;1535157186.0;"Exactly this. It's always been this way.So far, investing in this sector is basically just investing in Canopy. Traditionally they have seen and held the best returns. Diversification is almost pointless."
e4rday5;shakygator;1535155844.0;"APHQF/CBWTF are up over 12%, too."
e4rnz2p;souporthallid;1535164767.0;"I think it is in many ways psychological but also there are lots of retail investors who are buying a handful of stocks at a time instead of saving up for a single higher price stock. "
e4romia;LCJonSnow;1535165327.0;"That's correct, which is why it didn't make a ton of sense. At larger numbers, it can make sense to split to allow more people to invest (I generally invest $500ish blocks at a time, so I don't even consider stocks above that price). But $45 isn't a barrier to almost anyone investing."
e4sj46q;CarRamRob;1535195595.0;"Shows the investors they are chasing.  "
e4s37v9;thethiefstheme;1535178565.0;"They don't cash out, they get better deals, as they can dilute less. Stock price being high benefits everyone. Constellation has doubled their investment already. But yes, it is slightly slimey, but retail investors have made CGC what it is today and have been rewarded for it."
e4res7s;Meadhead81;1535157092.0;"Why is that? The percentage of investors in the cannabis sector was almost 90% not too long ago.So what if they capitalize on this? Dumb money is still green..."
e4r5lls;souporthallid;1535149250.0;"Thank you! "
e4rd5es;cacafogo;1535155713.0;">In accordance with the Share Split Resolution, the Board may, in its sole discretion, (i) implement the stock split within the range stated above or (ii) decide not to proceed with the stock split without further approval or notice to the shareholders.They can still choose not to split."
e4sj6r2;CarRamRob;1535195677.0;"Why?  It’s not like it’s a very low volume stock. That’s generally the only tangible benefit to splitting a stock, is to increase volumes of a tightly held entity.  This is not that.  "
e4sia5q;piglizard;1535194621.0;"Lol there are plenty of non-stupid investors who might not want to allocate that much of their portfolio for a single share of Berkshire Hathaway."
e4sipll;RedditGuy1000;1535195126.0;"i mean the company's intention of not splitting is to discourage bad investors in touching them, which is a fact"

9af24g;AutoModerator;1535313911.0;"If your question is "I have $10,000, what do I do?" or anything similar. There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer* How old are you?* Are you employed/making income? How much?* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?* Any big debts?* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!"

I want to put the money into safer holding, but I only have two bond options: BAGIX & SSFEX. I have never invested in bonds, any advise, should I consider moving to these? Based on the performance during the last recession neither one of these did very well at all?"

My parents still cover most of my expenses so my risk tolerance is decently high, I would be comfortable at about 40% ATM. No specific time horizon. I am asking for some good reads/ videos and companies to start researching for someone in my situation. Thanks! "

e4vgc7r;shayter;1535335804.0;"Hi I'm 24 looking to start something for retirement (35-40+ years), and maybe help supplement a future down payment on a house. (Maybe 5-10 years down the road) or to help with paying off student loans (2.5 years from now, about 25k)For the next 2 years I won't have much of an income due to going back to school. I'll only have a little bit to add on every month. Working part time at minimum wage ($11/hour) and will have a work study job ($900/semester). I may do some freelance jobs but those aren't reliable.__________I have about $2,600 at the moment. And started with $2,200 about a month ago.Bought/holding: CGC: 5 shares = $227CRON: 35 shares = $372Cash: $1985I've bought and sold SQ a couple of times.__________My risk tolerance is medium to low.. I'd like something that I know I won't loose too much on.I'm willing to sell CGC and CRON to increase profits.I'm using Robinhood for now, willing to change. But I like that there are very little to no fees.__________The questions I have are:1 - I've heard of dividend stocks, should I be looking into those now? 2 - Should I try to add on to what I already have right now for the time being?3 - Do you know of some stocks that fluctuate from low to high on a daily or weekly basis?4 - Should I hold CGC and CRON? Or sell now to put in something else?5 - What should I expect/do over the next 10+ years if I'm looking into using stocks to supplement my eventual retirement?6 - What resources should I be looking into to learn more?"

Blackjacks risks are fine by me with a small chunk of money (e.g. 1 or 2% of holdings)5. Got about €10000 in a index fund and €250 spread over (90 euro in s&p500, 55 euro in docusign, 30 euros in fagron, 15 euros in inapa, 45 euros in transenterix) i have another 7000 to invest which would still give me a 3000 euro emergency fund. Out of this 7000 about 6000 will go to the index fund with the 10k already invested and 1000 euros will be split over (600 euros aurora, 200 euros aph, 200 euros igo) 6. Only asset is a motorcycle 7. Id like to retire early ish but as im typing this i still have no idea about a job later on. Im about to graduate in 6 months with a bachelor in agriculte and businessmanagement. 8.

Otherwide expenses are pretty minimal. I do work the odd job here and there (fixing someones roof, helping on my dads farm) but all this money is cash. Currently i have about 800-900 euros in cash.

I make about 40k annually pre-tax, 25k post tax I think.3. I don't know what to do with the money. I don't have student loans and I don't do much nonessential spending outside of books and tech equipment. I guess I would like to not let it sit there and go to waste. Nearest financial goal is to make a nest egg for manufacture-heavy company.4. I can burn it up and it would maybe make me regret it a little.5.

I have a small unrelated brokerage account with about 2k spread out over blue chips and ETF's.6. Hard to say exactly as I will explain.7. Again, will explain.Hey all, I recently was gifted about $15,000 . I am a college student going into my junior year. Every year, I take on about 5k in debt that I will have to start paying off when I graduate. I think that is what is in my best interest to use this money for. However, I'm unsure how I should store the money until that time. I think I want to invest it in something like VTI, SPY, or maybe something a little bit riskier like QQQ through M1 Finance.  That being said, I am a little uneasy putting the money in right now as the s&p 500 has just hit all time highs. I would appreciate any advice about the best method of entry for me. DCA? Wait for a dip? Don't invest the money at all? Thanks."
e4xt4uc;jsf67;1535432882.0;"What fraction of your retirement savings are in accounts you didn't mention?  You want to look at the total of all accounts for asset mix, not each account separately.    I really hate suggesting bond funds in the current economy.  But at 8 years from retirement, you really ought to be including some bonds.    I don't think you should be betting on a recession and heavily switching to something safer.  I think you should just move a small fraction to one of those bond funds."
e4v7fik;jsf67;1535327027.0;"First don't miss out on any match available in your employer's 401K plan.  Did "no current holdings" imply no 401K yet, or you just didn't mention that?    Especially if you might be mixing retirement savings with saving for college for your children, the next $5.5K per year (and maybe another $5.5K per year for your spouse) should go to a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is likely best even if the money is intended all for retirement.  But it is more obviously best if you would need many years later to take out some or all of the original contributions leaving the gains for retirement.    More advice on accounts (401K vs. IRA vs. taxable) would depend on how much you can save and on other details of your situation and expectations.  $5.5K per year would be too little if you are saving for retirement plus helping your children with college.  But no sense telling you how to invest more if you can't save more.    Within whichever of the account types, you still need to decide on investment type.  My advice for moderate size (few thousand to few tens of thousands) investment toward long term goals is to put 100% into an S&P500 index fund with a low expense ratio, having chosen a brokerage where that is commission free.  Others in this forum tend to suggest more diversification than that."

e4vs3gk;optimiz3;1535347112.0;"Most brokerages have a procedure to directly transfer assets, no need to cash out (i.e. create capital gains/losses or distribution events).  Once your assets are at your new brokerage, you can sell/exchange them there."

e4wtv8k;tcd212121;1535400142.0;"This gift has come at a fantastic time in your life and I think you are sensible to suggest that you have low risk tolerance, given your debt will be increasing. Do you have any other savings at all? I would suggest that you look for the highest interest cash savings account for the time being. Keep an eye on where the best rates are and make the effort to chase them by changing accounts. Alternatively it could be used to reduce the amount of debt you are taking out in the first place each academic year you have remaining. Another option is to go and do some research into government bonds as these may be appropriate for your situation. With your timeframe, I personally would not recommend SPY (rated 5/7 by Vanguard on their risk scale to give you some feel) and certainly not individual shares, no matter the company. Set yourself up financially for graduation now, invest in yourself first where possible, and I think you will find that you do very well for the future making regular investments of what you can afford once you have stable income from a graduate job and have your debt levels at a managable level. You might even get lucky if this period in your life coincides just following a market dive :)"

e4vf7ur;Profitsloth;1535334703.0;"I hold about 30k in $mu because i truly believe that memory will be one of the cornerstones of our society with the whole internet of things. They also have low debt, are going to buyback about 15% of their market cap. And the memory industry has an incredibly high barrier of entry. I also hold nvda and amd, since they're the only major gpu makers, but I think they're quite risky because of their high p/e and the risk of one bad earnings report tanking the stock. Hold about 15k in each. The remaining 10k I use to trade more actively, but for the moment they're liquid."

Plus I wanted to just give a straightforward simple and honest suggestion that I believe to be good advice. Some People have down voted this comment, but you don't see them adding anything positive or constructive to the conversation. I think you can make some money with this stock and it's relatively safe. "

Also, I never really went as far as thinking about if they should put that full amount into any one stock, or some or whatever just making a quick suggestion. It seemed like they weren't getting any solid suggestions so went for it. But yes, taking 15 grand starting out and buying all just  one stock would be ill-advised. Haha"

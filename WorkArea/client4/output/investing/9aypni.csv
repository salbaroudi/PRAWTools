9aypni;FinallyLTU;1535490109.0;"Hello, I don't know anything about investing, I just got in argument with my sister about investing in banks.Question: I invest 500$ in any countries bank. Something happens and that bank shares go up by 2%. So I profited/got 10$ (my shares worth now 510$), right?   If not, can anyone please explain how it works.Again, I don't know ANYTHING about investing, I'm only 17 years old guy."

e4z04dd;digital_tuna;1535490283.0;"Yes, your math is correct.What's the argument?"
e4z04dt;SimDelCalSalBris;1535490283.0;"Investing in a bank can have various implications: It could be buying an investment instrument from the bank, or buying a share of the bank.Now, if you were talking about the shares of the bank, yeah you’re right. Although, we typically look at the shares in terms of points and not percentages. "
e4z1eu3;whrthwldthngsg;1535491667.0;"I'm guessing you were talking about different things. You were talking about investing in a bank (and your logic is correct).She was talking about depositing money in a bank account. Which is totally distinct from owning shares of bank stock."
e4z3p7q;whrthwldthngsg;1535493954.0;"That’s right. You get your money back by selling. It won’t necessarily sell right at the displayed market price. And as you note, there may be fees. So the exact amount you get will likely differ. But you have the right idea. "
e4z0ib8;FinallyLTU;1535490699.0;"Thanks for detailed answer :)"
e4z5b0r;alex6487;1535495450.0;">Although, we typically look at the shares in terms of points and not percentages. Why is that though? The same when talking about the change of the Dow or S&P 500. In the Netherlands we mostly talk about the relative change, which makes sense because an x% change today is of equal importance as an x% change 40 years ago, whereas a x point change becomes less important with higher prices/stock indexes. For individual stocks you also need to take into account stock splits etc."
e4z3cgk;FinallyLTU;1535493611.0;"Just to be sure. Example: 5 days ago PayPal shares was worth 86$ and now it's 90$. That is 4,65% change. So If 5 days ago I bought 500$ worth PayPal shares, it means that my shares right now worth 523,25$. Right?And how do I get my money back? I sell them with attached fees?"
e4z48mi;FinallyLTU;1535494462.0;"Last question: selling fees are incredibly high or just few dollars? Because it blows my mind how profitable investing can be."
e4z4jt9;whrthwldthngsg;1535494751.0;"Depends on the broker. But usually $3-$10 for equities trades. Some are free. Don’t forget you can also lose money investing. Especially on individual stocks. Things are good lately but keep in mind the possibility for big drops and make sure you would feel comfortable losing a significant chunk of anything you invest. Nothing you might need in the foreseeable future. "

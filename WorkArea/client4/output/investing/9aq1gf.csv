BP chief executive Bob Dudley has said the tariffs could increase its costs by $100mn. That amount could be reduced depending on how the administration responds to its request for waivers on nearly 14,000t of steel imports. Shell, meanwhile, is waiting waiver decisions on another 28,700t of steel that would mostly be used for its proposed 107,000 b/d Falcon ethane pipeline in the Appalachian region."

e4svesk;gghh01;1535216216.0;"it is priced in.  which is why you currently have to pay 16.9x 2019 earnings to purchase the S&P 500 earnings stream whether it is priced in *accurately* is the more appropriate question (ie. maybe we should we be willing to pay ~18x 2019 earnings or perhaps more?  maybe less?)

e4t3qxf;doougle;1535232217.0;"Expectations are priced in.  Sometimes expectations are over or under done.  Sometimes another thing happens that affects expectations and they change."
e4sxq9o;Surveyer13579;1535221705.0;"Think of it in a less macro context. The market values each company based on both its current and projected financial success. Think about netflix. It's P/E ratio is through the roof, but it's value has gone up tremendously over the past few years as people began to conclude that it has tremendous runway. Last, Netflix is a member of the S&P 500. That's how the index's future performance is already, technically, priced in. "
e4t4ny7;howj100;1535233377.0;"Think about it in terms of the discounted cash flow that each company produces. Imagine a company that returns $100 per year in cash flow. Because cash tomorrow is worth less than cash today, earnings from future years are worth less than this years, and that gets discounted more for each year it is in the future.&#x200B;Now look at the same company one year from today. They're still generating $100 per year, but they also just returned $100 to shareholders during the last year (maybe by dividends, by buy backs, or investing in the company). The shareholders now own the same future value of cash, but they also received the value of $100 last year, which was either paid out through dividends on increased the price of the stock. That's why the market keeps going up, even if expectations are already priced in - because future cash flows get closer to the present date"

e4treyh;ExtremelyQualified;1535256613.0;"Uncertainty.There are degrees of “priced in”. The more certain something is, the more the price reflects it. Until it actually has happened, nothing is 100% certain. "
e4u082x;electroze;1535265625.0;"There's no way 100% of everything is already 'priced in'. You could be first and only one to see an event occur that affects a stock and you happen to be at your computer with a buy dialog open and the 1 second it takes for your hand to click the buy button, someone will claim it's 'already priced in'. It gets ridiculous and there's no way everything is 100% priced in. Sometimes good or bad news takes time to percolate and lots of baby boomers still place trades via phone with their brokerage. Even the HFT pros can be unprepared for or miss an event here or there. It's not like they instantly know all things at all times. "

e4tz5yh;farmallnoobies;1535264500.0;"It gets more interesting with indexes basing their purchases on market cap too.i.e. AAPL is high market cap, meaning many indexes aiming for total market or 500 market are also buying it proportionate to it's percentage of the total market's cap.  This makes its valuation higher (more buyers and fewer sellers), meaning more total market indexes will buy it.There's a positive feedback loop with passive diversification that historically hasn't become a problem because the majority of stocks were owned directly.  Active indexes potentially avoid the feedback loop, but they have historically cost more than their gains warranted, so many people are thinking passive is the way to go. But once passive indexes become the majority owners of stocks, the feedback loop could cause some real valuation issues."
e4sv0z4;V-luong;1535215317.0;"Yup, it's just a theory. Fluctuations occur because people have different perspectives on the potential future value of cash flows of stocks."

9acet6;mobileboost;1535280118.0;How much cheaper is M1 finance to what I have?
9acet6;mobileboost;1535280118.0;"I have a Roth IRA at vanguard and a taxable portfolio at betterment. Vanguard is .15% in my set date retirement account 2055Betterment is .25% in all accounts. M1 is supposed to be free. Even if that's true how much does that really save me over 2 long established companies? How much does betterment and vanguard charge me when my accounts are $100,000 and how much will they charge me per month at $1,000,000?I'm trying to get real numbers to figure out how much it will be per month. "

e4ueqwr;YesThisIsBare;1535281345.0;"You're conflating expense ratios and annual account management fees. Betterment's .25% management fee is what you pay *in addition to* the expense ratios on whatever funds you hold in your Betterment account.Vanguard doesn't charge any annual management fees. So, if you own a bunch of VOO in a Vanguard account, you'll pay the .04% ER on VOO and nothing else. If you own a bunch of VOO in a Betterment account, you'll pay the ER plus the .25% annual management fee.M1 has no transaction fees or annual management fees, but you'll still pay the ER on VOO if you own a bunch of it in an M1 account."

e4uefnf;SafeLawfulness;1535280986.0;"The expense ratios on the target date funds don't change based on asset value at Vanguard. If you want to rebalance the account yourself you might be able to save 4-5 basis points when you qualify for admiral shares.Basis points do matter over time, but the questions you have to ask yourself are 1) what is it worth to have money at an established institution and 2) how does M1 make money? If they're not charging you on expense ratios, how do they keep their lights on?Best of luck!"
e4uh499;mobileboost;1535284057.0;"I looked up what an expense ratio fee is, but I still don't completely understand it. So when M1 says they have no transaction fees and no management fees, how do they still have a fee on just owning the fund? &#x200B;So if I have 1 million dollars in my Vanguard Roth IRA at .15% expense ratio, how much would they be charging me per month? &#x200B;When put this way, it sounds like Betterment would actually be very expensive since they are charging .25% management fee + the expense ratio? In the reviews and comparisons some sites show Betterment as actually being cheaper then Vanguard at some values. "

e4ugp3p;mobileboost;1535283559.0;"I don't see an option for admiral shares for the target date funds in my Roth IRA at Vanguard. I went to the option to be able to sell and buy new ones, but for target dates they only list the year funds and they appear to all be  .13-.15% fees listed?"
e4uj7l4;FatPhil;1535286693.0;"there are fund managers that manage the etf's allocations and every day/month/week the manager(s) have to rebalance the etf's allocations so no single assets outweigh others too much, or whatnot.  they get paid the expense ratio for managing the etf.  So a .1% expensio ratio means that .1% of the funds assests goes to the manager(s) for doing their jobs.  If you wanted you could try and do their job to save on this ratio but it would be a PITA for you to build a total stock market index in your own portfolio."
e4uk5n4;kiwimancy;1535287943.0;"M1 allows you to buy any stock or ETF. ETFs charge their own fee. M1 does not charge a separate fee.  If you have a million invested in a fund with 0.15% expense ratio, the fund is taking out $1,500 per year for management costs and compensation.  Betterment is more expensive than DIY brokerages but less expensive than human advisors who charge around 1% of assets (before fund fees) for clients under a million. Betterment also offers automatic tax loss harvesting which can be worth 0.25% or more depending on your circumstances."
e4ufbmb;SafeLawfulness;1535281992.0;"Looks like it's actually securities lending for short sellers.https://www.reddit.com/r/m1f/comments/7lj33z/how_does_m1_finance_makes_money/Maybe they have a superior product. Or maybe they'll stick it to you later down the line. Never know!"
e4ugu8v;SafeLawfulness;1535283724.0;"You wouldn't use a Target date fund in the above scenario. You would use the appropriate mixture of the underlying funds the target retirement funds use: VTSAX, VBTLX, VTIAX and VTABX.The drawback is that these funds don't automatically rebalance themselves like the target retirement funds do. You'll need to do that yourself."
e4uljht;mobileboost;1535289897.0;"I was told I can't use the tax loss harvesting, because I may own the same funds in my 401k or Roth IRA. I have 3 portfolios in betterment. I honestly don't understand what the problem would be exactly since I would pay taxes when I withdraw the money. So currently I have tax loss harvesting turned off. My betterment account will probably never go above 250k. It's currently at 4k. I'm 38 and make 25-30k a year. "
e4xshf0;Vosslen;1535432327.0;"Probably some data selling as well like credit karma etc. Could also get referral fees from business partners. Once you have the algo written and the website paid for all of your remaining costs are variable and you can scale to the Moon and take advantage of expanding margins."
e4v2slp;kiwimancy;1535321962.0;"Tax loss harvesting is when you have losses in one fund, you sell it and hold a substitute for a month. This allows you to lower your cost basis and invest the tax savings. Eventually you'll be taxed on the difference but you keep the returns on that savings. Over a long period it can be worthwhile.  But if you buy or even DRIP into a fund in your IRA within 30 days before or after you sold for a loss, it's a wash sale and you can't take the deduction. I think you actually lose the deduction entirely in the case of sheltered accounts."
e4v5ez1;mobileboost;1535324906.0;"So there is no reason to not have it in in a taxable fund as long as I don't pull out within 30 days? No matter what other investment accounts I have?"
e4v61mb;kiwimancy;1535325590.0;"Not sure what you're asking but the wash sale rule counts across accounts."
e4val2c;mobileboost;1535330224.0;"So if you have any other investmenting accounts that use the same funds then you can't use tax loss harvesting?Sometimes the funds change or I don't know what is in all of the accounts. Betterment uses a lot"
e4w6bq1;kiwimancy;1535362356.0;"You can but you have to take care not to imitate any buys within 30 days before or after. Betterment can't track what you do there so they err on the side of caution."
e4w93jk;mobileboost;1535365339.0;"Does anyone ever really watch that stuff? I don't even know how to tell what is being done in something like that. "

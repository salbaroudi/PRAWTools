9b4ef7;SmilingAmoeba8;1535531138.0;"As marijuana becomes more mainstream and the stocks take more hold in the market. I want to begin investing in it. It will be an excellent building block for my eventual over throw. However, I don't know anything about investing or stocks or how vast monies fly in seconds. And yes i realized this is not the place to ask such questions. But when 3 people are on the education Reddit and 2,000 are live here. I made the hopefully more fruitful choice. Do you have any good resources for me to start with? To learn about investing and stocks?"

But going from 0 investing to investing in individual, highly volatile stocks is like jumping into the deep end with your arms tied behind your back.  Still a good idea to learn basics about investing in general so see the side bar for that. I would start a general portfolio and then invest in some more risky things related to marijuana or whatever your research tells you.  "

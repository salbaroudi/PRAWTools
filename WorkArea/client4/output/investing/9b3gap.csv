9b3gap;darkm0de;1535523839.0;Max reasonable value of AMD
9b3gap;darkm0de;1535523839.0;"Hi, I'm wondering if anyone could enlighten me regarding what a reasonable max stock value for AMD could be within the nearest five years. It's currently at around 25 USD, whereas the Nvidia stock is at about 275 USD. I believe AMD is a company with a bright future, especially with the rise of AI using GPUs. So I'm just trying to get a ballpark about what you think about this.I suppose another way to phrase this question is; how come the Nvidia stock is over 10x the value of AMD? (Especially considering AMD has a higher yearly revenue than Nvidia). I suppose it's to do with that there are fewer Nvidia shares? Thanks for helping a newbie!"

You should be looking at market cap which is price per share x number of shares. Then you also want to look at current and projected future revenues to get an idea of how under or overvalued a company might be."

But seriously, come over to WSB."

e505uq6;swniko;1535527140.0;"That's why new listed companies, crypto projects, tend to release such quantity of shares/tokens so that the price per share/token is single, max two digit number. Immature people would rather buy 100 shares $20 each than 10 @ $200 or 1 @ $2000. They don't look at total number of shares and the company cap. "
e503kpn;darkm0de;1535525021.0;"Yes, that's what I was suspecting, cheers!"
e5046mv;darkm0de;1535525578.0;"That's less than I expected, maybe I should just sell now"

e5045q0;shobel87;1535525555.0;"No problem. You might’ve heard of pe ratio. This value sort of eliminates the confusion of the varying number of shares and tells you by what factor a company is valued relative to their profits. AMD’s PE ratio is actually higher than NVDA’s at this very moment. This fact has limited value though because, depending on what growth stage a company is in, they might not be prioritizing profits as much as pure revenue, which would inflate the pe value. "
e5070lq;ptchinster;1535528239.0;"Not per your post history. Its a great sub, learn why they are making fun of you.Market cap is what matters, WAY more than the individual price of the stock. Thats meaningless (except for requiring more to play options on that stock). People looking to buy fractional shares or 1 share dont really matter in the billions that companies can be worth.Also, if anybody knew what AMD would be in 5 years, 1.) they dont 2.) they wouldnt tell you because theyd be profiting the hell out of their time travel knowledge 3.) max value of a stock is infinite, it can always be $1 higher the next day 4.)  dont invest in individual stocks, stick to ETFs like SPY, 4.) if you decide to play options please reply and let me know which ones you are looking at so i can write them for you"

9avwrm;phaskellhall;1535459303.0;"I’ve been reading about 1031 exchanges and how you can basically roll over tax liability to future properties.  The advantage of this is once you die, your beneficiaries inherit your property with a new step up basis and all prior taxes owed are gone.Can you do this with a large retirement account or brokerage account?  Does this fall into the inheretance tax argument?  I believe the estate tax is around $5 million but does that include property too including 1031s?"

e4ym729;SumBaDee;1535465335.0;"If you let your kids inherit all your stocks the basis will step up to market value, and if they were to hypothetically sell right away there would be no capital gains tax."
e4yjqrc;jerschneid;1535461266.0;"I don't believe a 1031 exchange has any impact on the gift/estate tax. I believe all your assets you leave to your heirs including property would count. That said, thanks to the recent tax overhaul, [the amount protected from any estate tax was raised to $11,180,000 _per person_ who dies in 2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2017/10/19/irs-announces-2018-estate-and-gift-tax-limits-11-2-million-per-couple/#55ded4ca4a4b) (They seem to reevaluate this number every calendar year). There's no estate tax on anything less than that. If you have more than that, you definitely should talk to an estate planning attorney or someone of that sort. "
e4yu45e;aceman97;1535481871.0;"You can transfer assets to your children via a UTMA account. If you are married, you can transfer 30k a year to each child. If you give them one dollar over, you’ll need to file IRS form 709 which tracks the lifetime exclusion of gifts that you give your child. To recap:Married, couple can give their child 30k a year without triggering a gift tax. This counts against their annual exclusion of 15K if single parent or 30 if married couple Your lifetime exclusion is 11.3 million. Should you need/want to give your child more than 30k, you’ll need to file IRS form 709 with your tax return. This form is used by the IRS to keep track of the gifts you are giving your child. You can open a UTMA account at Fidelity very easily. Keep in mind that money in this account belongs to your child and you are merely the custodian. At 18 or 21, the money becomes theirs depending on the state you live in. Also this money will effect any financial aid they may receive when they go to college. Something to keep in mind, if you contribute 100 dollars a month when your child is 1 years old and keep doing it until they are 26. Stop contributing and never add another dime, @ 65 they’ll have about 1 million dollars in that account. This assumes they invest in a broad based US index fund, keep fees low, and never touch the money. Examples of these types of funds: VTI, ITOT, SCHB. "
e4yl2gm;monstimal;1535463347.0;"First, I've never heard of 1031 exchanges for anything but real estate investments.Second, what does this mean to you...> I believe the estate tax is around $5 million"
e4yupig;jsf67;1535482954.0;"Just to clarify, you are asking about ways to avoid inheritance tax on a very large estate, not ways to use inheritance to avoid capital gains taxes?    Retirement accounts don't avoid inheritance tax.  In fact, the built in tax liability of a pre-tax retirement account effectively increases the impact of inheritance tax.  The flip side of that is true for Roth accounts.  Dollar for dollar a Roth account has more value than a taxable account, but the inheritance tax only counts the dollars, not their value.    A trust can be used for a married couple dying separately to use the tax free estate amount of whichever dies first, without actually passing the assets at that time.  So the surviving spouse has control over and use of the assets, but that amount (whatever was estate tax free on the first death) is excluded from the second estate for tax purposes.  "
e4yv6rx;pharmermummles;1535483773.0;"The scenario I have always heard of is the inherited Roth IRA. Assuming you have enough in other accounts not to need it, a large Roth inherited by say a young grandchild would only require very small distributions, since they are calculated by life expectancy, and can grow mostly untouched, tax free, with completely tax free distributions."
e4zqtap;Valor_Frost;1535513865.0;"1031 exchanges only apply to real property (land, buildings). Vehicles cannot even be 1031'd for 2018 and later .... If you're talking about when you die and they inherit your stocks/securities, then the basis (cost) of the stock is the 'FMV' on your day of death. They then report gains and losses when they sell such stock using the basis step up"

e4z5qao;whathe2016;1535495841.0;"> They seem to reevaluate this number every calendar yearInflation adjustment.> There's no estate tax on anything less than that.At federal level maybe. There certainly is at state level.Sometimes it is more beneficial to gift your money before death, losing the stepped up basis at death, rather than paying state inheritance/estate tax.Say 50% of all you want to pass on is taxed at 15% long term rate. That's 7.5% of total estate value. State taxes can take more than that at death."
e4yzp9k;jcarmona24;1535489813.0;"also Fidelity offers two Index based funds (US and International) FZROX and FZILX that have 0.00% expense ratios."
e4yyqxy;Bubbagump210;1535488723.0;"Alternatively, you can setup a gift trust and control disbursement more tightly. This is the classic comedy trope.... but also where you can say no access to find until 25 or 35 or something."
e4z3znu;phaskellhall;1535494227.0;"Great info.  When I read stuff like this, I kind of get mad at the lack of financial education in our schools.  Every single parent should be doing this and every kid should be a millionaire by their parents leveraging compound interest at such a young age.  Another question for you, it sounds like you can “only” gift your heirs $15 million in their lifetime tax free.  If they invest this gift money, I assume gains on that contribution do not contribute to your $15 million cap right?  In other words, if you contribute $500k before they are 18 and it grows to be $10 million, then you die and they get your $10 million dollar properties, you’ve only given then $10,500,000 right?"
e4z49ez;phaskellhall;1535494482.0;"Final question, can your kids deposit this money into a Roth IRA?  If you are less than 18 and have no income, is there a tax on contributing $5500 into a Roth IRA?If you were to do this, they would have $218,000 by the time they are 18. Not sure if you can withdraw Roth money for education but goodness, that would pay for every kid’s college if parents did this for them. "
e4z3qjp;phaskellhall;1535493988.0;"I thought your heirs didn’t have to pay taxes unless they inherited $5 million.  Looks like it is $15 million now"
e4z4mu3;phaskellhall;1535494830.0;"I’m not sure I understand everything you wrote.To me it seems like buying your first property is like investing in a Roth IRA.  You buy your house all with post tax money although you can write off your mortgage interest (at the moment).  Then that property gains value but you can defer taxes by using a 1031. Obviously the Roth IRA has no more taxes owed at the end of your life but neither does your 1031 property chain.If you die with a $4 million dollar tradition Ira that has a basis of $1 million and gains  of $3 million, what happens to the taxes when it’s passed to your single child?"
e4z22ox;ballizlife2323;1535492360.0;"Trusts are horrible tax wise. What my wife and I did with our cpa is set up a partnership for our taxable accounts. In the future when our children are older we will add them to the partnership of which we have full control and have no obligation to equitably distribute profits, use what we want for our retirement + "subsidize" our adult children until we hand over the whole thing to them to manage."
e4z4v1a;aceman97;1535495043.0;"Nope. The 11.3 million is money that you give them. Any gains on those funds are taxable to your children. Let’s say you max out the 30k every year until they are 18. You gave them 540k and they did not pay tax. @65, it’s 20 million dollars. That’s 19.46 million in capital gains. Each time they sell stock. They have to pay long term capital gains."
e4z4x95;aceman97;1535495101.0;"Roth IRA is based on earned income. You can’t do this without getting “creative”. Which the IRS will probably disallow."
e4zclw0;FinndBors;1535501885.0;"if you are going to use this for education anyways, you might as well just use a 529."
e4z59id;monstimal;1535495413.0;"OK yeah. I wasn't sure what your understanding was from that and there are a lot of people who have been misled about "the death tax" in my opinion so just making sure."
e4z6cgi;jsf67;1535496407.0;"A pre-tax retirement account does not have anything similar to the step up in basis that some (certainly not all) asset types get in inheritance.    >  tradition Ira that has a basis of $1 million and gains of $3 million    A typical pre-tax retirement account has zero tax basis, so I think your example is confused.  In a traditional IRA, the basis is not the amount put in but only the post tax portion of the amount put in (normally zero).    Anyway, in your example, any withdrawals (including RMD) made by your heir come proportionally from the post-tax portion (if there is any) and the pre-tax.  Any pre-tax withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income (to the heir).  So there could be tax advantage if your heir has a lower tax rate than you had, but not the giant tax advantage given to inherited unrealized capital gains.    Some asset types with even worse inheritance treatment:  EE bonds: the pre-tax interest is counted at full value in pushing other assets over the inheritance tax free limit, then the pre Obama tax law was the heir pays tax on that interest when cashing the EE bond.  One of Obama's many subtle tax increases by Presidential edict (it is now the law, tested and upheld by courts, even though Congress never voted on it) is that the heir pays the tax on that interest immediately.Unrealized earned income locked into assets such as ESPP shares:  The law was always similar to what Obama changed EE bond law to, except that the tax is paid before the remainder counts toward push other assets over the inheritance limit (even the tax on EE bond interest can't push itself over that limit, it can only push other assets over that limit)."
e4z330x;jx1992n;1535493363.0;"> Trusts are horrible tax wiseDo you mind elaborating on this? "
e4z4oqx;Bubbagump210;1535494880.0;"Well, maybe terrible. It can avoid a lot of estate tax. You're still on the hook for capex and regular income in any event. Your taxes aren't fundamentally more in a trust. Though, munis and such can help. But yes, LLCs and such are other vehicles. It all depends on how you want to control things, how much you want to pass on etc. This is why you spend the bucks on the accounts and lawyers - structure what works for your deal. "
e4zbxox;FinndBors;1535501303.0;"Did you run this by a lawyer? I see a lot of negatives to doing it this way, namely that on inheritance the partnerships value will be subject to estate tax and also that the partnership distributions will be subject to income and/or capital gains taxes. I am not a lawyer or a tax accountant though."
e4z5z1p;phaskellhall;1535496067.0;"Man that is wild.  That’s the cheapest money they would ever “make”.  I just met with a CFA yesterday and he said he would always take a 25% tax for high earners.  If you gave your kids $30k a year for 30 years and never told them, they’d have over $3 million dollars and would only ever have to pay 10-20% capital gains tax depending on how much they withdrew.  If you just did a more modest $10k a year, that’s still over $1 million!  I’m using an interest rate of 7% by the way so it’s actually prob way more money in the long term of the market averages 10%."
e4z61ft;phaskellhall;1535496128.0;"You say it like it’s a bad thing.  If you only owed 20% on $19 million....that’s the deal of a lifetime!"
e4z5lnj;phaskellhall;1535495721.0;"How much do they have to make?  If your kids have a lemonade stand and make $200 a year, could you start this program?  Guess it’s not a w2 money but instead a sole proprietorship but if you went through the means maybe it would be doable.  If it’s possible, it’s def worth doing.  That’s a huge amount of untaxed money that could set your kid for life and only requires a few steps like setting up and LLC and doing a new tax return each year.  "
e4z6wvs;phaskellhall;1535496915.0;"Oh wow okay, why does the heirs withdrawal from the account count as income and not as long term capital gains? If they inherit the account and hold it for over a year, does any of the money get taxed as LTCG or is it always income because they didn’t earn the money so to speak?"
e4z5rgs;aceman97;1535495871.0;"If they/you get audited it could quickly get messy. My CPA commented that if it’s under 500 to 1000 a year the IRS will probably not care very much but if they consistently see 5500, they’ll take a look. Your mileage may vary. "
e4z7jce;jsf67;1535497471.0;"Withdrawal of pre-tax money from a traditional IRA is always regular income (not LTCG) regardless of who withdraws it or when or how long the money was in there.  The value has an effective multiplier because of the original tax deduction when pre-tax money was put in.  The higher tax rate on the gains (vs. LTCG) seems like it would eventually overwhelm that advantage, but if you run the numbers you generally find it doesn't.  The account normally causes you (and/or your heirs) to pay more total tax but also to have more left after tax (because more was invested).  In order for that to not work, the tax rate when withdrawing must be significantly higher than when contributing (there I'm just talking about comparison vs. taxable account.  For comparison vs. Roth, the word "significantly" is never needed there and Roth may win even if the tax rate difference is a little the other way)."
e4z642w;phaskellhall;1535496195.0;"It’s only risky if what you are doing is illegal.  Might have to wait until your kids are 7 years old to run a legit lemonade stand but if you do it all by the books assuming there is no law against it, I don’t see why it would be illegal.  "
e4z7z1f;phaskellhall;1535497855.0;"Man this is a lot swallow.  In general would it be better for the parent to buy property with their pretax accounts and the child to inherit the property with a step up basis?I understand the idea that pretax deposits are not taxed and therefore count as ordinary income.  Maybe what I mean to propose is just an ordinary brokerage account where all the money deposited in hmmmm has been taxed already and the earnings are all LTCG.  "
e4z9flx;jsf67;1535499140.0;"Dollar for dollar (of original contribution) a Roth account is better for your heirs than an ordinary taxable account, while an ordinary taxable account is better than a pre-tax retirement account.    If you wouldn't otherwise be using up the annual contribution limit, then dollar for dollar is a fair comparison for Roth vs. ordinary.  But it is never a fair comparison for pre-tax vs. either of the other types, because it ignore the multiplier effect from the original tax savings.    >  would it be better for the parent to buy property with their pretax accounts and the child to inherit the property with a step up basis?    That phase either includes a typo that destroys the meaning (maybe you meant "vs." instead of "and") or represents a more serious misunderstanding.  Anyway, I just explained the fact that it doesn't work the way that says.  The step up in basis is for ordinary (non-retirement) accounts.  A retirement account might work out better despite non getting that step up in basis.  But anyway it doesn't get the step up."

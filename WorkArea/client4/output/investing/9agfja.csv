9agfja;AnalystWynalyst;1535326846.0;"What's your thoughts on this? Machine learning and AI  would absolutely have impact on headcount reduction at a lower level. ER will see a significant impact of this trend as jobs for pattern recognition and data cleaning will no longer require an analyst. \-----Howard Marks believes top investors can still thrive even as trading machines become more active in the financial markets."Computers can do an unmatched job dealing with the things that can be counted: things that are quantitative and objective. But many other things — qualitative, subjective things — count for a great deal, and I doubt computers can do what the best investors do," Marks said Monday in a note to clients entitled "Investing Without People."Marks, whose firm, Oaktree Capital, had $121 billion of assets under management as of March, said computers can't do things such as meet and assess management teams, listen to venture capital presentations and look at buildings for real estate investments."The greatest investors aren't necessarily better than others at arithmetic, accounting or finance; their main advantage is that they see merit in qualitative attributes and/or in the long run that average investors miss," he said. "And if computers miss them too, I doubt the best few percent of investors will be retired anytime soon."Marks is known for his prescient investment memos, which warned about the financial crisis and the dot-com bubble implosion.The Oaktree co-chairman noted computers can help investors make more informed decisions, but they won't replace human insight."Computers, artificial intelligence and big data will help investors know more and make better quantitative decisions. But until computers have creativity, taste, discernment and judgment, I think there'll be a role for investors with alpha," he said.Marks has a net worth of $1.9 billion, according to Forbes."

e4v8ao5;Maxxenter;1535327903.0;"We are currently at a peak in machine-learning hype cycle plus machine learning sucks at doing much with non-stationary extremely noisy small sampled data. You also can't forget the marketing aspect to money management.  I don't think anyone that does anything with machine learning would think it is going to put every money manager out of business. What is going to be automated is all this data shuffling between systems that is currently done by humans. That is not even machine learning though. "

e4wn8tv;lion342;1535387166.0;"Howard Marks is wrong. I'm not going to say computers will overtake the field in a year/5 years, but it's almost a certainty that computers will dominate the field once we have a few more breakthroughs in machine learning/AI.Everyone thinks their field requires "creativity, taste, discernment and judgment" until they're soundly beaten over the head by a cold/unflinching machine.I'm old enough to remember when computers first challenged chess masters. Humans said chess required intuition, creativity that no computer can match. Well, that ended when Deep Blue beat Kasparov. Kasparov even insinuated that IBM cheated when he suggested one of Deep Blue's moves was made by the "hand of god"\* (i.e., wasn't a move made by a computer).The next challenge was Go (Baduk) -- but here experts doubted a computers ability to compete because similar algorithms used in chess (e.g., alpha-beta pruning, etc.) were useless in Go. The possibilities in Go are mind boggling. For the longest time the best Go computers couldn't even compete with kids (literally kids who are 7 years old).All that changed with AlphaGo. Anyone remember how cocky the entire Go community of "team human" was running up to the event? Lee Sedol laughed at the thought that AlphaGo might take a game off him. He realized very quickly he was in for a rude awakening.How about predictions that a self-driving car is impossible? A prominent person claimed that negotiating a busy intersection was hopeless complicated for a computer. Guess what, Google/Waymo does it on a routine basis now, driving 5000+ miles between needing human intervention.How about Jeopardy?I'm not trying to minimize the challenges of a computer succeeding in finance, but this field is exactly the quintessential problem that computers can solve.Howard Marks and his field is the Baduk community before AlphaGo came along and threw cold water on their face.On the other hand, Kasparov (chess), Lee Sedol (Go) continued to command large payouts in their fields despite losing to computers, so maybe Marks has a point. Jeopardy is still rolling with human players despite a peerless Watson.(\*In Kasparov's defense he knew it was only a matter of time before chess AI overtook humans, but he didn't think it would be so soon. He requested a rematch to which IBM declined.)"

e4wnqo8;G_Morgan;1535388298.0;"As somebody who's actually studied AI I think it is a long way away from replacing investment. There is no creativity from machine learning. All it can do is pattern match on what it has been trained on. It is a long way away from the kind of general AI needed to actually replace investors.I can see an heuristic maybe being useful to some formulaic strategies like passive investing. Making intelligent decisions though they are so far away that we don't even know what shape the chasm between reality and desire takes.It is always worth pointing out that the machine learning fad is just a bunch of better heuristics which have bumped the performance of some already well known algorithms. In the Go AI the cleverness remains in the Monte Carlo simulation itself, the machine learning just improved the heuristic driving it. Without the Monte Carlo simulation driving it the neural network is still pretty stupid. Monte Carlo is a strategic level AI for discrete perfect information games like Chess and Go. AlphaGo pairs that with a good move by move tactical AI written by machine learning.Machine learning has taken a bunch of problems with good strategic AIs and created good AIs in the move by move sense to go with them. Where there is no strategic AI that falls over on minutia already in existence I wouldn't hold any grand hopes for big outcomes."
e4vd36p;PutsOnINT;1535332603.0;"I think human investors will always be around because humans are the ones who need their money invested. It has already been apparent for a long time that indexing is superior to active management, but yet lots of money still goes to active managers. Humans are not rational!"
e4vgg5w;Hablamanos3;1535335912.0;"someone has to turn the machines on and off. Or at least turn the machines on and off that turn the machines on and off that turn the machines....Anyway, i do not think it is possible for computers to take every edge away"

e4v8hkg;AnalystWynalyst;1535328095.0;"This is the point of whole discussion. People who are selling investing software enabled with these technologies are bragging about the return and how they were able to beat the streets. I think they will be able to put a good chunk of low level analysts though because these analysts mostly sell side. I might be wrong if they are constantly providing value through corporate access. "
e4x31mh;lonewolf420;1535410313.0;"Its because very few people have the resources to even try. Its not like Google's DeepMind or IBM's Watson is going to go straight to managing money. You can bet Facebook,Google,IBM,Microsoft will get there when the tech is advanced enough. Currently DeepMind is focusing on Google products like google assistant and a more realistic text to voice (non robotic) software that can be outsourced. Watson is doing Healthcare stuff, Engineering, Cyber Security.​These systems are very complex and resource intensive, best use is for advancing humans and our tech not pushing numbers around a screen to beat markets when it could make whole new markets."
e4wnxg7;G_Morgan;1535388718.0;"> I'm old enough to remember when computers first challenged chess masters. Humans said chess required intuition, creativity that no computer can match.Chess isn't anything like investing. Chess has a fixed set of rules and a finite game state. Anyone saying that chess would be a problem for computers didn't understand either computers or chess.The problem with investing is as we've seen the game changes when investors play. The market responds to close out successful strategies. I have no doubt somebody will be able to make an AI that trades fine in a particular scenario but will fall to pieces when the rules of the game change. I'm sure an AI could have been constructed to automate the process by which vast mortgage securities fraud was done prior to 2008. That AI wouldn't have been able to cope with the collapse of the mortgage fraud industry and would have just had to be turned off after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.The problem is investment is a 40 year field. The key is surviving the moment the rules change every 10+ years and most strategies are about not being balls deep in whatever will cause you to lose everything.We do not have any strategy for managing this kind of process from AI. Neural networks are fucking stupid and all the successful neural nets have just been squeezing a few percentage points out of existing AIs that are good. For instance the main thing AlphaGo does is allow a Monte Carlo simulation to run fast enough to just crunch through more game states. It was really cool but it isn't a general solution to anything."
e4wvpcn;notfuckingcurious;1535402605.0;"\> . In the Go AI the cleverness remains in the Monte Carlo simulation itself, the machine learning just improved the heuristic driving it. Without the Monte Carlo simulation driving it the neural network is still pretty stupid.&#x200B;This claim is just straight up wrong. The raw AlphaGo Zero network (with the merged policy and value networks), without \_any\_ MCTS layer has an ELO of 3055. That's not far off the network which beat Fan Hui. It's obviously not generally applicable (and certainly not to investing!) or anything, but you're seriously underselling the feat of engineering. "
e4vg5qh;AnalystWynalyst;1535335630.0;"Lol"
e4wkit2;Special_Agent_Utah;1535381334.0;"People that are bragging about their return, are they bragging on other metrics like risk adjusted returns? That’s probably besides the point because I think the people are bragging about their performance in a bull market with a small sample size. I haven’t seen any of these claimants returns or claims so this is me generalizing hardcore based on my perception of people and their behavioral. "
e4wp69b;lion342;1535391548.0;">Chess isn't anything like investing.Chess isn't anything like driving a car either. My point wasn't that chess AI would solve investing. It's that investing is exactly the type of problem that's amendable to analysis by deep learning/AI.If anything investing is a much more closed universe than driving a car.​>It was really cool but it isn't a general solution to anything.Not saying AlphaGo is generalized AI, but you're under-appreciating how significant the breakthrough was. The DeepMind team continually improved the system to the point where it taught itself Go. Then it taught itself Chess.​Again, I'm not minimizing the challenge of investment computing. It's probably a   difficult challenge, but it's not insurmountable.Also, "the rules change" is pretty meaningless. What if you threw Waymo's car into the desert? Think they'll have a problem driving there?If the Go sponsors decided to change the board to a different configuration and "change the rules" you don't think DeepMind can just change their configuration file and rerun?edit: one more point, humans are atrocious decision makers under stress. Computers are cold and unflinching. Kasparov, Lee Sedol, Ke Jie, literally the number 1s in their fields and had difficulty optimizing moves against the computers. Also Ken Jennings on Jeopardy was considered a robot with his precision buzzer clicks lost to Watson all the same."
e4wq87k;G_Morgan;1535393835.0;"> The DeepMind team continually improved the system to the point where it taught itself Go. Then it taught itself Chess.This is marketing bullshit. They gave it the params that define victory in chess and had it train itself to them. Arguably this is much less efficient than starting with a known move book to train against but they did it from green fields just because self training AI is something you can sell to laymen."

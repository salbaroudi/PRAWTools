9as7k6;Hughjassbahonar;1535428543.0;My friend has discovered FOREX trading...
9as7k6;Hughjassbahonar;1535428543.0;"He seems convinced he's going to become a millionaire, and is paying for 'one on one mentoring', which he can get for free if he refers 2 friends - which sounds a lot like MLM to me. How do I break it down / break it to him that he's probably going to lose all of his money; also he isn't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed lol."

e4xo4re;TefonDon;1535428762.0;"Give me his contact, I'll trade for him. No need to learn anything, he just needs to send me the money and by this time next year he'll be a millionaire! "
e4xq7tp;mangoroti;1535430468.0;"forex is real but my god there is so much snake oil.... tell him he doesn't need anyone and all the needs is a broker, tradingview.com to analyze and lots of studying. you don't need anyone else. you do NOT need an MLM platform to trade either. yes more than likely he will blow his first account. people treat it as gambling as well.... its a dangerous game. rewarding tho, but you have to really like it. "
e4xo4mc;Brendan1620;1535428759.0;"Simple: you shouldn’t have to recruit people to have your “education fees” go away. If it was truly mentoring or something along those lines, they themselves would help you learn their patterns and the way they trade, not how they recruit people. That’s all mentors are, they tell you how to get more people into the company. "

e4xrx29;SmithRune735;1535431867.0;"Id stop calling him your friend and move on. "
e4xsjhr;Project_Zero_Betas;1535432376.0;"The only question he needs to ask is "Long or short bolivar?""
e4xsw04;MedicalLabScientist;1535432671.0;"Education is expensive...Good education is really expensive"
e4y1ti3;rjm101;1535441310.0;"All you can do is encourage your friend to minimise the impact. Trade a small account for a year or two. If he/she is just breakeven by the end of it then let them be. My uncle did the same thing. He dished out 10k on a course and probably a little more on the mentoring. Ended up stopping after a couple of years as it wasn't working out. It's a lot to dish out on a course. You're better off reading as much as you can and sticking to investing."
e4yqb4w;Radeh;1535473629.0;"Nothing wrong with trading currencies (although I recommend doing so through futures, not spot forex due to fees), but your friend is falling for one of those asshole "failed traders turned marketing pros selling dreams".So yeah, he's falling for an MLM scam. Tons of those exist in investment sectors that have low barriers to entry (penny stocks, forex, binary options, etc). The old "if it sounds too good to be true, it's probably bullshit" applies. The easiest way to convince him is to ask the MLM provider to provide a verified 3 year record of his performance. Not some rinky dink demo account statement or selective trades...3 full years of performance. If he can't do that, and he won't, he's FOS. If he wants to learn the basics, [Babypips School](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex) is great and free. Actually a pretty good site for trading basics in general.To be clear, the site teaches you the basics, not a fully fleshed out strategy. Developing that is on your friend. He needs to define clear entry/exit parameters and sound risk management strategies...and then test the hell out of them (objectively). That's a lot of work, more than most are willing to commit."
e4xobhm;SafeLawfulness;1535428920.0;"I recommend this short game to anyone under the delusion they can time the market.https://qz.com/487013/this-game-will-show-you-just-how-foolish-it-is-to-sell-stocks-right-now/Forex is like timing the market on crack. Or highly leveraged stupid. Don't jump in the tank with sharks.Your friend is experiencing a highly addictive physiological rush of dopamine and/or serotonin to his brain and that is extremely difficult to overcome short of losing everything. Physical intervention may be the only way to help him not hurt himself-- it's not overly dramatic to think of this as a serious drug addition. Short of that--pray."
e4xpen2;schmiddy0;1535429802.0;"He'll get an education one way or another, that's for sure."
e4zdc5q;VPride1995;1535502496.0;"Isn’t forex zero sum?"
e4yxxae;Pogbalaflame;1535487712.0;"At least try to warn him first, no? If he ignores it by all means move on"
e4xq4cc;Hablamanos3;1535430386.0;"That is a horrible game.. only able to buy and sell once?"
e4ysl2c;_potato_man;1535478762.0;"What a joke"
e4ze6px;mangoroti;1535503203.0;"sure like most trading. to me its mostly a game of probability if you know technical analysis. don't play it like its a casino and eventually you will become profitable. i do forex and the hardest part if patience and discipline, not even the actual trading. 90% of traders fail because they think its a get rich quick scheme. it is a legitimate form of trading, just like stocks. you just have to know how to play and stick to your plans. "
e4xql3y;SafeLawfulness;1535430778.0;"So naturally, you were able to beat the market consistently since it was such a simple decision matrix, right?"

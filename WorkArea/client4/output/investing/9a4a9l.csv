9a4a9l;seanmcmahon314;1535201070.0;ARK Invest has a $4000 five year price target for Tesla. Thoughts?
9a4a9l;seanmcmahon314;1535201070.0;"Here it is:https://ark-invest.com/research/tesla-privateThe primary assumption underlying the $4000/share, $700B market cap thesis is basically that Tesla gets to fully autonomous driving before anyone else and monopolizes it.What does /r/investing think of:1. This thesis?2. This valuation assuming the thesis comes to fruition?"

e4snv02;MeesterWeen;1535201725.0;"Monopolizes how? Alphabet is working on autonomous cars with Weibo, Apple has articles coming out claiming they are working on the ‘iphone of cars’.. in no way could Tesla monopolize this tech with these two giants plus others throwing tons of resources at their own projects.  just don’t see it happening. "
e4soz7q;Hablamanos3;1535203442.0;"nope"
e4soyti;MeesterWeen;1535203426.0;"Ford mkt cap is 39.2b, GM is 50b, and Toyota is 177b so a 700b market cap would make Tesla about three times more valuable than all three combined. But IF they become the monopoly of autonomous vehicles, they aren’t a car company, they are a tech powerhouse so actually yes I could see that valuation. They’d probably split in that case rather than have $4000 a share though. "
e4sojjs;userandaloser;1535202760.0;"Who do you have to fuck to get a $4000/share target price around here?"
e4srwlw;hemegeah;1535208584.0;"Look at the underlying MaaS assumptions - they will have 4.2 million vehicles on the road, charging $1/mile of which Tesla gets a 30% cut, with each vehicle contributing 116K miles/year on this Tesla network.  I get it's the bull case but any reasonable pressure test would say that's ridiculous."
e4sx2yz;dvdmovie1;1535220204.0;"Why is their 2023 q2 bull and bear ev outlook both the same? Also Tesla isn't going to have a monopoly on self driving. This is some ridiculous fangirling by the ark manager."
e4t0evk;Shasta_doktor_g;1535227196.0;"Saw her interviewed today on CNBC. I think ARK has an outsized position that they're trying to exit. Had all kinds of hypothetical answers"
e4t406l;evilgrinz;1535232540.0;"Possibly, but they are competing against companies with A LOT more resources on this end. I dont think they end up achieving it solo, they would have to partner with someone."
e4t47zb;dirtee_1;1535232814.0;"I know a guy who mans a self-driving lyft car here in Vegas. The cars can only go certain places where the street has been mapped out for two years in advance and the cars can't do seemingly simple things like pull out onto a street where there's a red light ahead and coast up to it, they try to accelerate to the full speed limit and then do a hard brake at the light. Fully autonomous driving is still a long ways off..."
e4t4obi;doougle;1535233390.0;"I think you'll find there are many differing opinions about the market in general.  If you favor one over another that's your choice."
e4spwup;genericscotch;1535204952.0;"Even if they monopolize it do you really believe autonomous driving will become the norm, and that the average driver is willing to pay up substantially for that ability?"
e4t1w0s;justmentioning;1535229612.0;"So why is everyone expecting Apple or any other random startup to come up with a solution for self driving and totally forget about actual car companies? They might be a little slow but they doesn't get their credibility from fancy tech demos as many others do..."
e4t3lds;ClaymoreMine;1535232016.0;"You are forgetting Volvo, MB, Porsche, BMW all working on standardization and they have all agreed LIDAR is the standard as of now. "
e4snwlu;seanmcmahon314;1535201792.0;"The technology has to get certified first. It is possible that one company makes it to the finish line a substantial distance ahead of the others. What about the second point? Do you think this happening would justify such a high valuation? Do the numbers make sense?"
e4toceh;lemongrenade;1535253487.0;"I mean is there international competition? If they owned it for sure american car sales wouild explode internationally"
e4sot3d;seanmcmahon314;1535203170.0;"The article was written by Catherine Wood"
e4t4aum;seanmcmahon314;1535232914.0;"They're a long ways off for the company who programmed autonomy into that car. Where is Tesla in comparison?"
e4wkglb;Juniper00e;1535381214.0;"Depends if liability for accidents shifts from the driver to the tech."
e4t1zo9;gamer31;1535229769.0;"Because those are actual software companies that don’t have to worry about the overhead of being an actual manufacturer?"
e4tk6ei;zachmoe;1535249362.0;"My wife."
e4tb1ao;dirtee_1;1535240313.0;"I'd hazard to say it's probably about the same. "
e4t6pln;justmentioning;1535235800.0;"What do you mean with worrying? These companies currently invest billions in self driving incl all the infrastructure needed to achieve it.Writing some good object detection is only half the work you have to get done to fulfill future government/safety regulations. They know that there are many ways to monetize self driving cars. "

9a3uma;uniqueguy263;1535196590.0;"[Here’s a blog post Musk just made outlining it.](https://www.tesla.com/blog/staying-public) Thoughts?"

e4srkk7;ObservationalHumor;1535207949.0;"> I worked with Silver Lake, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who have world-class expertise in these matters, to consider the many factors that would come into play in taking Tesla private, and to process all the incoming interest that we received from investors to fund a go-private transaction. I also spent considerable time listening to current shareholders, large and small, to understand what they think would be in the best long-term interests of Tesla.Morgan Stanley was on board for what 3 days?  Goldman maybe a week?  And we know he does analyze this stuff full time.  Like you were literally talking to the Saudis for weeks about this but managed to determine everyone else's stance in a handful of days?  Just admit there was no serious offer on the table, that no one had actually been consulted on the issue and you impulsively tweeted that this was a real possibility already.  It's clear that's exactly what happened.> Although the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was “please don’t do this.”The ego on this guy is astounding.  "I'm doing you all a favor here!" which of course is why this being released at midnight on a Friday.  I'd love to know what shareholders he actually 'spoke to' and how many people got a call at all here.  That two-thirds number was likely complete horseshit.  The number of things he flat out lied about or willingly misled people on in the course of the last three weeks is just comical at this point.> I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it’s clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated. This is a problem because we absolutely must stay focused on ramping Model 3 and becoming profitable. We will not achieve our mission of advancing sustainable energy unless we are also financially sustainable. "I didn't know taking a company private would be a lot of work".  Said the chairman/CEO who already bought another company for a few billion dollars two years ago.  Yeah you should be focused on the Model 3 ramp too and absolute case scenario here Elon Musk has yet again just wasted time, resources and energy on another project that'll never get off the ground instead of focusing on actually fixing your company's operational and financial condition.  Some phantom short seller conspiracy has never been a risk to the company.  Elon repeatedly doing stupid shit like this over and over again is.  Here's a guy who has repeatedly said he best and only candidate to run this company and constantly asserts he's smarter than everyone else flat out saying he didn't understand very basic factors that would be involved in taking a company private.  I've said it a million times but Elon's business strategy is literally one of the stupidest things I've seen but people will continue to assert he's some kind of genius playing 5D chess all the time.> That said, my belief that there is more than enough funding to take Tesla private was reinforced during this process.So much so that your cost of capital wouldn't have more than doubled right?  So much that major I banks could consider it all in a handful of days.  I swear only Elon Musk could admit he did something stupid and impulsive and then proceed to spin it as somehow reinforcing his original viewpoint.All that happened here is that Elon decided that the president potentially being impeached and investment media being focused on ARK's ridiculous valuation model for the company would hopefully provide enough of a distraction for him to completely backpedal and prove detractors right with the minimal amount of blowback possible.  Hopefully people will ignore all the former employee reports suggesting that Elon has no idea what he's doing at a technical level or that his policy of terminating dissenting employees or any who doesn't "believe in the mission" has more in common with failed communist regimes and cults than it does successful stewardship of a multibillion dollar company."

e4th5yh;StacksOnStacksOnStax;1535246408.0;"This smelled of fraud and desperation since the original 420 tweet.  As a credit analyst with close to 10 years experience this is my theory, and it is very similar to the Elizabeth Homes ("EH") / Theranos. In fact the parallels between Tesla/Musk and Theranos/EH are extremely similar.1. Both EH and Elon set out to change the world. I applaud them both for attempting this and strongly believe we need more visionaries.2. Ego got in the way. Instead of being honest and saying "hey it is more difficult than we thought"  they both continue to promise unrealistic expectations. First small lies, then once you are down that path, the lies just get bigger. Elon landed a rocket from space, how embarrassing would it be for him to fail at something as simple as manufacturing? EGO.&#x200B;Desperation moves are apparent.  The 420 tweet was an unprecedented move by Musk to raise capital.  Smart money knows that Elon is trying to goose the stock price up to avoid paying convertible notes. Telsa's will likely run out of cash by mid 2019 based on my cash burn projection.  However, it could be sooner if suppliers start getting nervous and require COD versus unprecedented 90-120 day payment terms.&#x200B;I predict Elon's next move will be to pay its suppliers in stock versus cash and spin it as "long term partnerships are great! blah blah blah"  if you see anything like this run for the hills."

Tesla is a $5b luxury automotive company pretending to be a $50b, future Toyota + global energy company. But when you look past the marketing BS, their books are of a manufacturing company that's bad at manufacturing dependent only an inflated stock price to stay alive. The bear thesis looks more accurate every day. Tesla needs to raise billions by the end of the year, they are running out of collateral for loans, and they have tons of convertible bonds that will hurt them significantly early next year if they can't keep their stock price high. It's a house of cards with a CEO who seemingly pumps the stock price with false information because he knows without a high stock price, the whole thing crumbles. He said funding secured at $420, solar panel roofs, a Tesla Semi, the pick-up truck, 20k model 3s per month by 2018, self-driving tech, etc. So far, the bears are right, it's all been BS. At the end of the day, they're a car company the produces 1% as many cars as companies with a similar market cap. They can issue new stock and stay alive for another year or two but it's unlikely that'll do anything beyond delay the inevitable. It's becoming pretty clear Chapter 11 is the right path.I say this all as a Tesla shareholder. I bought a couple years ago, I don't like to sell positions, so here I am with my bags. I think the ship is going down though. I wish it wasn't, Tesla has a great vision, but dogshit operations and management. A good vision by itself is not enough.Let me put it this way, if Tesla traded at a $10k/share, or $1.5T market cap, would you still buy it because of the vision?

Their manufacturing tech turned out to mostly be a lemon, they've had to revert to more traditional means to build cars?I'd ask you to explain the tech that explains a 1,000% premium but... I'd rather save us both some time. I don't really care how you'd explain that, you can't in my mind. You do you. I'll do me. I hope Tesla files Chapter 11 and then becomes a great car company. They're too in debt right now to get there. They're a $5-10b luxury car company and they need to restructure to make that happen."

I use options essentially for leverage / extra payoff on a particular bet (I bet Tesla will go bankrupt rather than merely down, in the case of my puts. I bet Tesla will at least not rise significantly, in the case of my sold calls). On the other hand, short selling captures smaller movements profitably which can be harder with options (also actually quite possible to do with options and in an effectively leveraged way as well, but I don't actually want that much extra volatility around short-term price movements)."

e4vy1fj;vanguardtouchedme;1535353298.0;"I do FBA and I feel that some are getting frustrated because sponsored listings easily take up a bunch of space on search results and you essentially have to bid on your own brand as a keyword to keep people off your search results. Additionally, Amazon advertises their own brands heavily on your pages too, but that I can understand more as competitive business. We noticed this years ago because Amazon has always been scraping data - it was a matter of time for them to identify categories with healthy margins, easy to produce, etc. and of course they can source a good enough quality when Amazon wants to be your customer. The margins on being an advertising platform are great. You're going to see a lot of platforms push some form of auction based advertising among people using their channel/marketplace. This in an economic sense is fantastic for the businesses because competition in auctions generally leads to higher PPC costs. Additionally, Amazon's algorithms support velocity. They generally take a commission + a possible fulfillment fee if the seller is using FBA. Therefore they really want to be a toll way type of business through use of their fulfillment and advertising services. FBA was an easy way for me to generate more sales because of having that Prime badge next to my name (bigger players can do 'seller' fulfilled prime but they are held to high metric standards). Likewise, Amazon's algorithms can reward higher listing rankings if your sales rank is up (how many units you sold that day versus everyone else). Amazon basically wants the bigger pockets to pay for somewhat inflated PPC costs by other competition. It's working and is heavily pushed by Amazon's seller support teams at events all around the country. Edit: Another thought, once voice really starts picking up I can imagine the advertising costs to be a sponsored product on Amazon will be huge. The device will likely offer 3 options at most and the device is naturally friction less and thus consumers will likely take whatever's offered. Better converting advertising services means more revenue from selling advertising. "

e4x1xcq;vanguardtouchedme;1535409266.0;"Except they have really incorporated a long term strategy that Bezos has likely planned out way in advance. These organizations have roadmaps planned for decades of what they want in fruition. Likewise, Amazon is highly exceptional with their usage (and secrecy) of internal data and use that to lead them. Some products and ideas have flopped but overall these guys hardly miss and are a big reason why no one has seen disruption at this scale and efficiency. As their ecosystem grows they also become stronger through the ecosystem itself and by wearing out competition through attrition - they don't need to beat you in your market they just want to apply pressure and force you to compete, mostly on margin.

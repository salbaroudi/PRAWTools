9ahncq;sanssouci0;1535336148.0;"for the average investor, investing in individual bonds is next to impossible.  true???? what do you think?from my own experience ,  i  was trying to buy US-T Note and placing the order  Good Till Cancel for 16K  when a box amount showing minimum from 1K , i am  waiting and waiting and waiting ,,,, hello ,,,, anybody is there? ,,,,waiting ,,,my order not filed yet ,,,,waiting started a chat with a broker :\- you can see that the offer size for most of the day has been 10,000k which is larger than you bid\- the bond dealers do not want to trade  smaller than 10,000k and they are not any obligation to do so.If it is  so , all the information on investing in bonds is misleading and an average person hasn't have a chance to invest in US Treasuries. What do you think?&#x200B;"

e4vh2jg;NonrestrictiveBroom;1535336530.0;"You can buy bonds through TreasuryDirect straight from the US treasury department, it’s pretty simple. "
e4vk1ae;lolomfgkthxbai;1535339402.0;"I’ve bought plenty of individual bonds, it just takes longer and usually won’t be at the best price. Put in an order that is above the market price and you should be fine."
e4wobuq;G_Morgan;1535389616.0;"By individual bonds it likely means corporate bonds that tend to trade at prices of $50k. Diversifying away from that is going to be a nightmare.Sovereigns tend to be traded in smaller denominations. The UK has always used a standard of £100 and most other nations set their system up to emulate the BoE."

e4vh90f;NonrestrictiveBroom;1535336699.0;"I don’t think it’s restricted to US residents. You can also buy bond funds as a substitute to actual bonds. Such as BND.Edit: so it looks like you do need to be a US citizen to use TreasuryDirect, in which case I’d recommend bond funds. Or see if your country has an equivalent to TreasuryDirect. "

e4vorga;ducatista9;1535343889.0;"You know how much money you’ll get back at maturity - the return of your principal (assuming the bond issuer doesn’t default).  In theory a bond fund would give the same total return as laddered bonds of whatever duration / rating the fund holds, but depending on the details, it might not at any given moment.

e4vq93v;lolomfgkthxbai;1535345328.0;"Due to EU regulations it has become hard to buy bond funds. E.g. TLT is not available at all, I assume the same goes for the other usual bond funds."

e4vrdla;sanssouci0;1535346412.0;"it is hard to get a real life information about taxes for a non US resident holding bond funds, trusts and etfs.it took time  before I get him answered my questions if he withhold tax on  interest from us treasuries and corporate bonds . For now I have only one sure answer that  he won't withhold tax on treasuries and corporate bonds.Also i have a limited choice of brokerage companies which are working with non us residents and one which i have an account offers only  etfs and cds."

e4vsk6t;sanssouci0;1535347579.0;"i am a newbie in investing and trading. my original idea wasn't been trading. i was thinking of buying  premium , paying commission and  an accrued interest and holding to maturity to get a principal and the last half of a coupon. it is actually very small amount but still better than my money lying in the current account.

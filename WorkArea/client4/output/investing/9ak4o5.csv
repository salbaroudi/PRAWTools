9ak4o5;bluesbird82;1535355898.0;Pay taxes now or defer later?
9ak4o5;bluesbird82;1535355898.0;"This is prob the million dollar question and I still don’t think I understand which is better.  I just met with a CFA and he said it was best for me to start a 401k for my business and pay up to $55k a year into it. His reasoning was it’s better to postpone taxes today (currently in the 35% marginal bracket with $550k gross income a year) and let the largest amount of money create gains in a 401k over the next 30 years.  He said I would make 2-4% more each year investing pre tax money vs just paying the taxes now and having post tax money in a brokerage account.Here are some ramblings that maybe someone can help me understand:1) 401k is pretax but how is the entire account taxed when I withdraw?  Is the gains taxed at capital gains rates but the principle is taxed at my retired income tax bracket OR is all the money taxed at my retired income tax bracket?2) considering a long term max tax liability of 10-20%, is there really any way to beat this rate?  My goal is to retire and pull $72k a year to live on 4% of my total investment portfolio (not counting SS). If this amount was taxed as income, my effective tax rate would be around 12%.  If I held post tax investments, my effective tax rate would 10% on that same amount of withdrawal.Any help understanding why it’s better or worse to pay taxes now vs later?"

e4w0ijq;bluesbird82;1535356039.0;"My buddy and I have been debating this over and over and here is his much more concise question which should result in tangible $ amounts for debate.**You make $500k currently. You can put 50k into a 401k today and in 30 years pull it out and at that time you are making 250k. You expect to make 8% average per year. Or you could take that $50k, pay taxes on it, and put it in the same stocks and average 8%/year for 30 years. What are the pros and cons of each?**"
e4w3bax;NoviceDreamer;1535359092.0;"I think it Depends on what you think your future might be. Right now I am in a low tax bracket & with my outlook. It like Roth better. I rather pay my low taxes now not knowing if I will jump in tax brackets.I can withdraw my contributions without fees Incase of a real life emergency (hope I never do)When I retire what ever growth my Roth IRA has I don’t have to worry about for RMD ( which will hopefully allow what RMD I have keep me in a low tax bracket. )So technically you are both right. I think it depends on the person.Like if you make 500k I think Roth IRA can’t be part of your equation.  Idk if it’s true but I remember reading that Roth 401k does count toward RMD"

e4whwnm;bonghits96;1535376603.0;"Shit, you make enough money, talk to an accountant.But yeah it's generally better to defer whatever taxes you can."
e4yxjxz;FIinvestor;1535487232.0;"1) Entire amount is taxed as income at retirement. Presumably you will make less money withdrawing in retirement than you do now.2) You can combine pre and post tax savings to reduce taxes. Ex. If you withdraw 75k a year from a pretax account, you will be taxed on around 60k of it. If you withdraw 15k pre tax and another 60k post tax, you pay no taxes.Being a buisness owner you also have to consider the opportunity cost. In some cases it night be wiser to pay taxes now so that you have additional capital to reinvest in your buisness."
e4w1fu2;NonrestrictiveBroom;1535357060.0;"I am no tax expert and I am sure others on here will be able to help you more. With that said my take is: Depositing into 401(k) now - The pro is that in your scenario you would get taxed at 33% instead of 39.6%. The con is that you have to pay the 33% on your compounded returns instead of just on your principal. The second scenario, do you pull out your money tax free at the end of the period, like a Roth-IRA situation? - if so - the pro is that you get to keep your compounded returns without having paid money on the compounded cash. Personally, I contribute to both a 401(k) and a Roth-IRA to cover both my bases, a pre-tax and after-tax account."
e4w7ou5;kCinvest;1535363820.0;"​I'm not sure I get your question, but this is how I interpreted it:You have two alternatives. You can put 50k into a 401k for 30 years earning 8%/year OR you can pay taxes on the 50k, and invest it for 30 years earning 8%/year.The **obvious answer** is that it will always be better to have your taxes deferred until a later point given that all else are equal. Let me illustrate my point with some math:​|Action|Year 30 *(pre-tax)*|Year 30 *(after-tax, 35% rate)*||:-|:-|:-||**(A)** Invest 50.000 401k|503.133|344.536||**(B)** Pay 17.500 in tax, invest 32.500 (35% tax)|327.036|223.948||**Net gain (A-B)**|**176.097**|**120.588**|​"
e4w31as;klausshermann;1535358800.0;"Good call on 401k and Roth-IRA, I think thats the best way to go about it to diversify pre tax and post tax dollars to investment accounts so you can pull from whichever necessary in retirement. Only issue for /u/bluesbird82 is that they are making too much annually to contribute to a Roth-IRA see here: [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2018](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2018)"
e4wb2lq;Ovechkin103;1535367517.0;"I may be reading the table wrong, but are you taxing alternative B a second time at the end? "

e4wc3j6;kCinvest;1535368678.0;"I fixed a misscalculation there, but since you do not have to pay taxes on your original investment this is how i calculate the tax:  For A:(503133-50000)(1-0,35)+50000For B:(327036-32500)(1-0,35)+32500"
e4w65nt;klausshermann;1535362171.0;"Would you mind explaining what these are, how they are structured/taxed, and what the actual process is for setting them up and making contributions? I would appreciate it, I've heard the terms thrown around but never gotten a good explanation. Thank you."
e4wcofb;Ovechkin103;1535369354.0;"But isn't the (327036-32500)(1-0.35) just taxing again? Your money is already taxed at the start such that you can invest 32500 instead of the full 50000 and from there whatever you make you can take out tax free, right? "
e4wf6af;bluesbird82;1535372499.0;"Here are some more details I think need to be added to make this easier. 1) let’s assume you are married filing jointly.2) let’s assume you take out the entire amount although I’d argue you should only take out 4% during retirement but if my buddy really thinks he’s going to make $250k in retirement then none of this matters because that’s an insane amount of residual income.  I think for A you would figure out the compound interest and total account value at the end of 30 years, and tax that the correct tax brackets starting at 25% since $250k a year married jointly would be at the 25% bracket.  For B you would need to assume $50k is still being invested each year but also figure out the taxes paid on it at prob 35% assuming you’d max the contribution but pay tax with other money not in the 401k.  The total amount I calculated this account would be worth after 30 years is 6,798,016.  You would then withdrawal that amount at retirement with a long term capital gains tax of 20% (assuming the tax laws don’t change).   This amount is 5,440,000 but you have to also subtract the taxes you already paid on the yearly deposits which should be 875,000 (50k x .35 x 30 years). So if I’m correct it should look like this A: $6,798,016 - whatever income tax is at 25% rate and upB: $5,440,000If I take $6,798,016 and minus the $600k that leads up to the 37% tax bracket, and tax the remaining money at 37% I get over $2,293,000 in taxes alone! So if I’m correct, it looks like A should be 4,504,751.Therefore choosing to do the 401k and defer taxes and pay a “lower tax rate” later in retirement would actually cost you over a $1,000,000 over just paying the taxes each year and paying long term capital gains on the entire portfolio.

e4wdba5;bluesbird82;1535370108.0;"I am not eligible to make a $5500 contribution to a Roth IRA directly but I can make a $5500 contribution to a traditional Ira.  I can then roll it over to a Roth IRA, pay taxes on the $5500 and essentially have invested into a Roth IRA even though I’m ineligible. With the mega backdoor, I would deposit the max contribution with company match (around $50k) into my 401k and then roll that over into a Roth IRA making s much larger contribution than you could typically make ($5500k max).  You’d pay taxes during the roll over but you’d have a huge Roth IRA deposit.  Apparently this is partly how people like Mitt Romney wound up with Roth IRAs with millions invested.  "
e4wdnxl;kCinvest;1535370537.0;"If I employ you and pay you $100, you pay $35 in taxes, and invest $65. Now if you make capital gains on that investment you have to pay taxes on it. Whenever you sell those stocks, you are either going to be realising a gain or a loss. If you realise a gain, you owe taxes, if you realise a loss, you can deduct taxes.The law on this differs from country to country but I think this model is pretty common"
e4wvemg;klausshermann;1535402225.0;"Thank you this is the first good explanation of it that I’ve gotten. Can you roll a backdoor or megabackdoor into an already existing RothIRA or does it get rolled into a new account? Wouldn’t make a difference dollar wise I guess just in terms of having everything in one place and organized. "
e4wgdwx;TheNextFaker;1535374222.0;"I thought if you pay taxes now (Roth IRA), you don't have to pay anything later (not even on gains)?"
e4ws3q7;Ovechkin103;1535397399.0;"Correct, my assumption was it is a Roth vs traditional. If it's a traditional vs just brokerage investing then obviously take the tax advantaged account. If it's the former then I'd you're expecting a lower tax rate in the future Traditional will make you more money, if you're expecting to take out the money at a higher tax rate then Roth is the way to go"

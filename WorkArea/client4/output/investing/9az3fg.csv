e4z6zjf;Lostboy500;1535496978.0;"Your gains (profit) are from the appreciation of the underlying stocks that make up the ETFs, so yes your gains come from the price of the ETF rising, but if there are dividends associated with the stocks that make up the ETF you will be paid out on those as well."
e4z4bdx;rr1r1mr1mdr1mdjr1m;1535494534.0;"It comes from the guarantee that you can trade shares of the etf for its constituents."

e4zqodn;supjeff;1535513752.0;"When you sell a share of an ETF, you're selling it to another investor on the exchange, right? I could see how if you were selling the ETF back to the fund, you'd get exactly what the share is worth in relation to the fund's net asset value, but that's not what's actually happening, is it?"
e4zdyi0;HeyzeusHChrist;1535503015.0;"i own a lot of ETF for my retirement, but they do make me nervous.  they are kind of like a derivative and if people decide to panic sell them en-masse, they can move differently than the underlying assets they represent.  "

e50cyuz;_buscemi_;1535534031.0;"and correct me if I am wrong, but the dividend payments from the underlying stocks are reinvested"

e4z6lvr;itsyaboi117;1535496643.0;"Thanks! "
e50bx53;Shareholding;1535533031.0;"You can only sell an ETF on the open market. You do not sell it back to the issuer; although you can exchange it for its constituents if you’re an institution. "
e4zfhm3;Lostboy500;1535504292.0;"Not going to say this could never happen, but if you’re talking about largely liquid products, with underlying domestic large cap stocks, the chances of that are quite low due to many of the reasons discussed above (if the etf starts to move dramatically lower than its intrinsic value of its basket of stocks, many would see that as an arbritage opportunity).  If you’re trading in some exotic frontier markets with very illiquid stocks, I would think that would be a more likely scenario of that possibly happening. "
e4zgqy6;blitzzerg;1535505392.0;"The same could happen if you bought individual stock, right?"
e4z9t8z;OystersClamsCuckolds;1535499471.0;"> but if there are dividends associated with the stocks that make up the ETF you will be paid out on those as well.Not necessarily, since OP is not from the US (I assume), he has access to accumulating ETF's that don't distribute dividends from the underlying stock. "
e4z4vyi;Herzogmeow;1535495067.0;"If you have enough ETF Shares, you can ask to turn those Shares into the underlying individual stocks"
e4z4mu6;rr1r1mr1mdr1mdjr1m;1535494830.0;"I thought I just did. What doesnt make sense.?"
e4zmmbc;dfsw;1535510343.0;"No an individual stock will always equal the underlying value of itself which is the individual stock. An ETF is made up of many stocks but can be traded in and of itself so it’s possible though unlikely an ETF can be oversold and it’s value decreases beyond the stocks that it’s comprised of. However this is likely seen as free money for an investor. It’s like a have a bag full of gold coins, people buy that bag as an investment because the know the value of the gold it contains is $10,000. However the market panics and everyone sells their bags of gold, there aren’t enough buyers so the price drops to $9000. Now I can buy the bags for cheap and crack open that sweet bag of $10000 in gold. "

e4z69jd;Lostboy500;1535496333.0;"while this is technically true through the redemption/creation process, the size to do so probably isn't applicable to the average investor and is mostly an institutional tool"

e4zpjpb;blitzzerg;1535512804.0;"what I meant is that people can also panic sell a stock and if no one is buying then you cannot sell either plummeting the price"
e5005re;UGenix;1535521850.0;"What is the difference between an ETF being under-/overvalued and stock being under-/overvalued? A share price is the market's interpretation of the value of a company too, not the actual worth of the company."
e4zciba;ServerOfJustice;1535501800.0;"In some countries ETFs are not required to make distributions but rather can just reinvest dividends or capital gains thus making it more tax efficient for the investor.~~I don't know why he assumed OP is not from the US, though.~~"
e4zck7z;JimmyBiscuit;1535501845.0;"You can either have ETFs that pay out dividends, or you can have ETFs that directly reinvest into themselves."
e4zchhw;Gentlescholar_AMA;1535501780.0;"It is 100% true as determinant of the value. It's the same as any currency or commodity backed currency. In the United States prior to Nixon, the value of the US dollar was based on being able to exchange it for gold. This, however, was available exclusively to other nations and some few institutions; but it still determined the price of a dollar for everyone.In other nations that peg their currency value to the dollar, they do the same thing -- have dollars on hand to allow their currency to be exchanged for dollars at the specified ratio. This is, again, only available to large or specified institutions, but it still determines the value.The fact that an ETF can be turned into shares **does** determines the ETFs value, even if every owner of an ETF cannot do so and only some institutions can."
e4z978u;throwawayinvestacct;1535498938.0;"I'd say it's sort of a (I hesitate to use this terminology) trickle down effect (or, really, just the market). The average retail investor may not be doing the whole redemption/creation process. However, because institutional investors can, individual shares held by retail investors retain a value very close to the value that process provides. If an institutional investor could redeem shares at $20/share in value, retail investor's shares won't stay at a price much below that for long, as the institutions would gobble them up."
e4z9t8l;MasterCookSwag;1535499471.0;"Eli5 has never had a literal connotation.  There's too many people who are lazy about learning and just reply "eli5" without bothering to specify what they don't understand. "
e4za3k7;rr1r1mr1mdr1mdjr1m;1535499721.0;"Oh you want to literally be explained to like you're a five year old.You know how you and Tommy own that lemonade stand? Sometimes other people will pay you to share ownership in the lemonade stand. You might never see them, but because you're being a nice boy and following the rules, you have to give them some of the money you make selling lemonade. Sharing is caring. Sometimes a big rich man starts a stand that, instead of selling lemonade, sells partial ownership in your lemonade stand.But sometimes little boys and girls aren't good at selling lemonade, so the big rich man wants to buy many lemonade stands to make sure he still gets money even if one of the lemonade stands he owns shuts down.But what about all the normal people who can't afford to buy a share in 1000 different lemonade stands? Well the big rich man has created an "ETF" for them. They buy a small part of the ETF from the big rich man, and the big rich man promises that if they ask nicely they can trade the share in the ETF for shares in 1000 different lemonade stands.This means that the money they pay to own shares in 1000 different lemonade stands should be the same as the money paid to own one share of the ETF. Otherwise a smart finance man can buy the ETF, and turn it into 1000 shares in different lemonade stands, and sell those shares for more money."
e4zr8gc;dfsw;1535514219.0;"Ah, that isn’t what the initial comment was talking about, it was about an etf not equaling the value of the underlying asset"
e4zw9wv;Lostboy500;1535518471.0;"it will be very rare that "no one is buying" a stock, I have never seen it happen (assuming you're talking about a normal notional amount in a liquid stock).  There will almost always be someone buying, it might not be at the price you want, assuming you aren't talking pink sheet/penny stocks.  If we are talking traditional large cap domestic stocks, liquidity isn't a huge concern.  Liquidity at the price you want to sell at though, well that's a whole different topic."

I’m in mutual funds.> While mutual funds have made dividend reinvestment easy, reinvesting your dividends earned from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be slightly more complicated. Dividend reinvestment can be done manually by purchasing additional shares with the cash received from dividend payments or automatically if the ETF allows.> Automatic dividend reinvestment programs are not yet available on all ETFs. In addition, the longer settlement time required by ETFs and their market-based trading can make manual dividend reinvestment inefficient.https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/112415/how-reinvest-dividends-etfs.asp#ixzz5PW9gSUlm Follow us: Investopedia on Facebook"

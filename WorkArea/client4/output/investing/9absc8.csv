e4unrbf;damanamathos;1535293554.0;"There's plenty of finance movies apart from Wolf of Wall Street. Not all of these are recent. The more recent ones tend to deal with the 2007/2008 financial crisis.[Margin Call](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1615147/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2011) is about an investment bank at the beginning of the financial crisis. It has the most realistic feels of any finance movie I've seen, very much enjoyed it.[The Big Short](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2015) is about the hedge fund managers that bet on the housing crisis and financial meltdown of 2007/2008.[Too Big To Fail](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1742683/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2011) is basically the same story told from the perspective of the banks/regulator.[Inside Job](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1645089/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2010) is also the same story but is a documentary.[Wall Street](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (1987) is a classic and worth seeing.[Wall Street 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027718/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2010) is nowhere near as good, though I'd see it to add to the collection.[Rogue Trader](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131566/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (1999) is the story of Nick Leeson and the the fall of Barings Bank. Gives a glimpse of derivatives trading.[Barbarians at the Gate](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106356/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (1993) is the story of the LBO of RJR Nabisco.[Trading Places](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086465/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (1983) is a comedy that gives a slight introduction to commodities trading.[Pretty Woman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100405/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (1990) some may call a romantic comedy, but it's really the story of a corporate raider who changes his investment style.[Other People's Money](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102609/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (1991) is a Danny DeVito film about a corporate raider.[Boiler Room](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181984/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2000) is a story about dodgy stockbrokers.[American Psycho](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2000) is not really a finance film, but the main character is an investment banker.Same for [The Family Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218967/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2000), where Nicolas Cage plays an investment banker who has traded away the happy home life for work, etc.[Arbitrage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764183/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2012) is a Richard Gere film about a hedge fund manager, but I didn't find it very good.And of course outside of movies there's [Billions](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4270492/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2016- ), a series about a hedge fund manager."

Based on the true story of a Toronto bank employee who embezzled more than $10 million to feed his gambling habit, Owning Mahowny was named one of the ten best films of the year by critic Roger Ebert.*****Brian Molony**Brian Molony is a Canadian self-admitted compulsive former gambler from Toronto, famous for embezzling millions from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the second-largest bank in Canada, to feed his personal gambling habit.Molony, who had developed a passion for the race-track and gambling from the age of ten years, and acted as a bookie for his school-mates, graduated from the University of Western Ontario in London with a degree in journalism.  Initially planning to be a financial writer, he did so well in a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) aptitude test that he was put in their management-training program and hired right out of university.  Molony spent a few weeks as a teller before working in savings, current accounts, foreign exchange and loan accounting, then "floating" among some of the bank's huge network of some 1,600 branches, which gave him a further broad exposure to the bank's highly regimented workings and familiarity with its systems and internal weaknesses.  On a modest annual salary of about $10,000, Molony led an unassuming lifestyle in Toronto, wearing inexpensive, ill-fitting clothes and leaving carefully calculated seven per cent tips in restaurants.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

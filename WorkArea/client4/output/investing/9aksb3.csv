9aksb3;happytravelbug;1535361554.0;"Will we be seeing 50-70% drops in some of these high growth tech stocks much like 2000 which took 5-10 years to recover back at pre recession prices? What about the housing market?"

e4w66p2;KevZero;1535362204.0;"Yes. Overall, we will see about a 23% drop in the S&P500 in the first 4 days, with Russell hitting -33% and NASDAQ taking a walloping 46.8% hit. You can then try to play the bull trap over the next 2 weeks which will see two massive rallies and a third, smaller one. From there the market has about 3 weeks of daily losses in the 0.3  - 2% range before settling into a bottom where it will stay for about 9 months before we finally see DOW beat 20k again.More precise dates as well as tickers can be provided for a small fee."

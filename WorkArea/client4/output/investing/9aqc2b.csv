9aqc2b;misterno123;1535415512.0;"I called Fidelity for these 2 cusips, this is the largest bank in Turkey and their yield is very high&#x200B; XS0808632250  XS0982644774 &#x200B;Customer service told me these cusips have Regulation S attached which means Americans can not buy it. So I searched reddit and found this thread[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6ehi9m/can\_one\_buy\_reg\_s\_or\_144a\_securities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6ehi9m/can_one_buy_reg_s_or_144a_securities/)&#x200B;My question is, if I call a brokerage in Europe and buy it thru them, would that be illegal?"

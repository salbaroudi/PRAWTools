9aj78d;manwiththemach;1535348019.0;"Hi everyone.Average amateur stock investor here. I wanted to run this buy some folks and see if there were any areas I was especially vulnerable, or if there were any big companies or industries I should be taking advantage of. Of course, I will take all advise under advisement, and begrudge no one for the info they provide. Since April 27, 2016 I've gone from 26,800 to a high of around 35,100. My investment philosophy has essentially been:\#1: People are idiots.\#2: Things will get worse before they get better.\#3: Go long term.[https://i.imgur.com/D1obdMl.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/D1obdMl.jpg)I'm heavily into defense and technology as you can see. I don't see the world getting any less dangerous, and technology is a saving grace by allowing people to live more comfortable, safer lives. Even in the event of war, disaster, and climate change. I'm pretty adverse to things that aren't vital infrastructure in someway.A few thoughts:FANUC was an attempt to tap into the growing automation market. I probably should sell it, but it was mostly an experiment.I plan on hanging tight on BABA since pretty much everyone I've found says it's likely to recover over the long term.I have 10-20% trailing stop losses on most of these stocks. I know it's preferable to ride the market most of the time, since the market usually recovers after big crashes.Any thoughts or suggestions?"

e4vvm4y;noloze;1535350686.0;"I'm going to be blunt so that maybe you'll take a critical look at what you're doing and you'll save some money.You've been underperforming the S&P and there's nothing in your post that makes me think you can beat the market. You're probably going to underperform like most active traders. So if I were you I would put 90% of my money in ETFs, and use 10% for your own picks, and only up that % after you prove you can beat the market.Sorry for the buzzkill, and good luck."

e4vvwyw;JustAsIgnorantAsYou;1535351008.0;">I plan on hanging tight on BABA since pretty much everyone I've found says it's likely to recover over the long term.Everyone you've found sucks at accounting if you didn't get a huge warning along with that advice. "

e4vuds4;BaskinRobinson;1535349421.0;"You should diversify."
e4vwkd1;manwiththemach;1535351699.0;"Replies: I'm not against ETFs, but I do want to understand the businesses I'm investing in more thoroughly. It's a valid point thought. Are there any you'd recommend other than ones tracking the S&P 500 or Dow?Also, you say it's under performing the S&P 500? As I said it's been a total growth of around 23% vs around 15% compared to the same time period with say Vangaurd S&P 500 ETF. I typically don't jump in and out of stocks, can you elaborate? As far as diversification, I had heard utilities are a relatively safe bet. Are there any defensive ones people would recommend for closer research?"
e4w5mi5;WilliamNyeTho;1535361600.0;">\#1: People are idiots.Op I would just like to remind you that you, me, and everyone else, are indeed people."
e4vwrjp;manwiththemach;1535351915.0;"It's one of the few companies I've seen a unanimous buy rating with CNN finance. Now, that wasn't the only thing that made me attempt to buy in, I was aware of the risk. But perhaps you could explain your view?"
e4w00ov;noloze;1535355489.0;"Maybe you gave the wrong date? I plugged in April 2016[https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/)Total S&P: 36.508%You: 23.3%I would do something simple like 75% S&P fund, 25% emerging markets. Maybe 5% leverage from some place cheap like IB.Only pointer I can give you is to keep learning. When you say stuff like "I had heard utilities are a relatively safe bet. Are there any defensive ones people would recommend for closer research?", it doesn't sound like you have an edge. I've been at this for a while and I consider myself lucky if I have 3 good ideas a year. I come up with the ideas through tons of reading and brainstorming, and I only hope that my ideas are stuff the market hasn't recognized yet. They're my ideas, and I don't ask anyone, because if you go about it that way, you'll get sucked into narratives that sound good but don't have any substance. Enron had a terrific narrative before it blew up. It's very easy to make a bear and bull case for most stocks. Same goes for any successful investor I've ever read about. You won't find people who have beaten the market asking questions like "what's a good utility stock?" because that won't lead them to any fresh ideas that generate alpha. And having fresh ideas is the only way to beat the market.tl;dr: You need to figure out your edge &#x200B;"

9aba4o;clam_powder;1535269604.0;"I’m not super well rounded on trading but these accounts are clearly scams. Curious to know if anyone can shed any light on what it is? Surprised I’m not hearing more about this since everywhere I go on Instagram, these guys pop up."

Scam. "

e4uzmbj;the_wonder_llama;1535317863.0;"My cousin used to post tons of profit pics and inspirational quotes about being wholesome and making money (like that Knowledge guy) like you'll see on many forex Instagram pages (what's up with that?) Then, he stopped posting and it has been almost a year. Coincidence?"
e4yqkb3;Radeh;1535474204.0;"They are failed traders turned marketing pros selling dreams. You find a lot of those assholes in investment sectors that have low barriers to entry. Same thing happens for penny stocks and stuff like binary options.Nothing wrong with trading currencies though. I'd do so via futures and not spot forex though due to more transparency and better fees.Those "coaches" make money through affiliate fees with brokers and you paying them stupid amounts of money for basic crap you can find online for free if you just put in the time."

e4v9dj6;killerguppy101;1535329006.0;"That sounds like fun and I'd love to go to one of those events.  My parents used to tell me stories of how they would go to random timeshare events, with great knowledge about realty investing and taxes.  They would lead the presenter on, and then start asking real questions and exposing them for the shysters they are.  Eventually, the presenter would get pissed off and explode at them "WHY DID YOU EVEN COME HERE?".  "Well, your rep out front offered use $20 to sit in on your shtick".  I've done a couple of these presentations too, getting free or cheap stays at fancy resorts.  After the first few minutes of the 1-on-1 with a rep, they always say "aw jeez, not one of these people again".  And then it's over, and I go back to enjoying my free spa and private beach."

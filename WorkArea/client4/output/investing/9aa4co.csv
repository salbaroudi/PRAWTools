9aa4co;someguy2040;1535259702.0;Question: How to use beta to compare a sample portfolio to SP500? (also whats the best RF rate proxy)
9aa4co;someguy2040;1535259702.0;"Sample portfolio: beta = 1.06, 14% returnSP500: beta = 1, 9% return (during the same time period)Rf rate: 2.42% (1yr treasury)&#x200B;Is the risk adjust return for the portfolio 9.4%, meaning it generated alpha of 4.6%?"

e4ty8pi;Helikaon242;1535263552.0;"Yes, your math is correct but your explanation is a bit off. Using the parameters you've provided, your *expected return* given a beta of 1.06 is 9.39%, so the difference of 4.6%, your actual return less expected return, is alpha.Generally for retail investing, the treasury rate corresponding to 3 or 5 years is most frequently used (generally best to use the rate which is most similar to your investment horizon).Note that the CAPM can be criticized for oversimplifying performance, and for failing to explain risk. When comparing portfolios, it may be worth looking at some more comprehensive risk metrics like expected shortfall or value at risk (VaR). Also be mindful of how beta is calculated, as you want to ensure that you're not sampling too long or short of a period so that beta properly represents the correlation to market."

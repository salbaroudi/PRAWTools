9ayz5b;jakegold0826;1535492210.0;"Anyone have an idea why they opened low? Everything I’ve been reading (including news from today) indicates movement in the opposite direction "

e4z2aim;dvdmovie1;1535492581.0;"It nearly doubled since the 14th. A pullback should not be surprising and if anything, it's healthy after the run this has had post-Constellation news.Things don't simply go straight up until negative news. "
e4z4z6a;eskjcSFW;1535495151.0;"Profit taking"
e4z9i8a;subnero;1535499205.0;"Profit taking.  Might be a good chance to buy more."
e4z9n6t;SquishyClouds;1535499325.0;"My assumption is that it'll be a bumpy ride for CGC and CRON in the next week. Both stocks are traded mainly on speculation, so the past week investors were taking advantage of the profit opportunities.We'll have to see what happens, but I currently have 7k in CGC, and im holding and watching"
e4zl2pt;rjm101;1535509048.0;"Constellations massive $4billion investment bought CGC at a premium price of $48. After the news the market was set on making this the actual price of the stock so it kept surging up. The following day after it reached $48 the stock fell because I'm sure a lot of traders had this as their take profit point. That's my theory anyway."
e4zb48a;Harlow197;1535500593.0;"People pulling back after the hype train went too far. Was kind of thinking that the weed boom would last a week or two longer because the Diageo deal is still lurking out there unresolved."
e4z2bl7;jakegold0826;1535492610.0;"Figured the pullback would come closer to October with a jump after sales start in Canada "
e4z9phz;jakegold0826;1535499380.0;"I have much less then that but I am a new investor (only 1500 in the market) seeing this dip as a chance to reinvest, thinking this will be a good long term stock to have"
e50asjx;Good_Comment;1535531950.0;"This along with competitor TLRY having a solid earnings report today and an absurdly volatile jump of ~20% after hours.Short term people are trying to find the next CGC because of rumors of a similar influx into a CGC competitor by other beer companies"
e4z37f3;Aranthos-Faroth;1535493478.0;"No"
e4z5x0g;neve1064;1535496015.0;"I think veteran traders understand that you can’t be greedy. When you’re making these returns it’s wise to take them off the table and regroup. I’m expecting this to go lower but I’m really not worried about it. This is a long-term hold and I will be selling covered calls and occasionally cash secured puts when appropriate. If it dips down to the mid 30s before October 17, I wouldn’t be surprised. However, According to the call options volume at 40 and 50, there are quite a few people who are expecting to See this reach 50. I also think this will re- test the highs established yesterday eventually before October 17.  "
e4za88o;-Johnny-;1535499835.0;"I would look into stz. I do own about 3k in stz right now. For me it is a safer bet. They already have a great business and have the possibility to have the majority in cgc if they want in the future. They currently own 34% of cgc."
e4zacvt;SquishyClouds;1535499946.0;"Could be very possible considering the growth potential for both CGC and CRON thanks to Canada's decriminalization of weed. But we really don't know enough about these companies to know the long term value of these stocks.I would play it safe for now and watch the market for a while to see what happens. And if you can, make a couple of day trades on the stock through the week when you think there will be an upswing. Just remember the pattern day trade rule if you're considering doing that."
e4z60tk;jakegold0826;1535496112.0;"I’m not experienced trader but most canadian stocks are down today I think the dip has something to do with the new deal between Mexico and US. Material goods are the only thing up on Canadian index, I didn’t expect the stock to continue to rise without any dips but it seems quite coincidental that the timing would coincide with the new trade deal"
e4zaiq0;jakegold0826;1535500085.0;"Yeah considering that or playing it even safer, I’m saving for school when I go back and so thinking about putting my money into an actively managed fund or ETF"
e4zc7df;lolomfgkthxbai;1535501537.0;"If it's money you need then hell yes put it in an ETF or even treasury fund. Short-term speculation with weed stocks is closer to gambling."

9b01az;time2roll;1535500070.0;How do you interpret a stock that settles at a level for after a period of upward trend?
9b01az;time2roll;1535500070.0;"For instance, a stock that has been going up consistently and gradually from say $10 to $19 over the period of 6 months, but then stays around $19 for the next 3-4 months and doesn't really push beyond that.Is that some sort of market indication one needs to read into?  Is that the market's way of saying perhaps that's the fair value? Curious to see what people on this forum do with positions that have experienced the pattern above."

e4zc5mp;rebelde_sin_causa;1535501495.0;"If a stock goes from $10 to $19 per share in a 5 year period that's good. Expecting more than that is just getting greedy. Not that it doesn't happen. Basically either you're holding for the long term or you're not. Every stock has periods of consolidation."
e4zcl20;Nettletooth;1535501865.0;"The pattern you describe is a pattern called "consolidation".  It represents buy/sell rough equilibrium, given known data.One way to look at it is to say "this is fair value", but not everyone knows everything about a stock, a market, a country, an industry, etc.  People can draw different conclusions in regards to what future growth and profitability(or shrinkage and unprofitability) looks like and their projections, so different people can have different opinions in regards to true value.A trend will start when the data changes, or how people interpret the data changes and adjust their projections, and therefore, appropriate stock price.What I do with such a pattern depends on my underlying assumptions in regards to value and growth.  A lot of times, I am happy taking the quick profit and will sell covered calls and look to reduce my exposure, and place a covered call on, say, 50% of my shares. That way, I monetize the stagnant stock price, and lock in profit if it is called away, and gather downside protection, reduce my cost basis, etc.Other times, I may just sell outright because I think that there will be a drop, and I can sell a cash covered put at a lower strike and look to get back in at a lower price at some point and take some profit and protect some of my downside."
e4zwdvd;Col_John_Matrix;1535518564.0;"From a Technical standpoint It’s called consolidation. It generally means old buyers are selling out to new buyers and a new base has to form for it to move any higher. From a Fundamental standpoint people are adjusting to the new levels and figuring out do these prices make sense and can it go higher. Depending on peoples opinions it will likely bounce around til momentum carries it higher or it starts to fade and collapses back towards prior levels."
e4zwp0e;Lostboy500;1535518827.0;"Too many variables to say for sure, if this is a small/micro cap stock it could simply be a few institutional players building larger positions over time driving the stock up gradually. The fundamentals could have improved significantly over the last 6 months either for the company or the industry as a whole that caused the stock to double and that catalyst is now priced into the stock.  I'm sure opinions will vary, but the market's indication of "fair value" is whatever the stock is currently being sold at this very moment, theoretically stocks are constantly being traded at "fair value", but that value is constantly changing due to supply/demand, analyst price targets/research, etc.  All comes down to Efficient Market theory, which has its debates as there are clearly active managers who provide alpha generation."

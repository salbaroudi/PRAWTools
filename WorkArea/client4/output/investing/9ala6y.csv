9ala6y;SimplicityIsKing;1535365990.0;"https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=256423Just allot of great content that I believe everyone would benefit from reading."

e4wn4hx;chak2005;1535386891.0;"That thread is a good example of investor bias, actually several biases. Its my one pet peeve what that community. The bogleheads community is made up of some solid and knowledgeable investors, however when it comes to international investing many there let their emotions and preconceived dogma get in the way of reason. While the debate of "how much should you allocate to international" or for non-US citizens "how much should you allocate to US" can be discussed until the heat death of the universe, to actually say the US market is all one needs is very foolish in my opinion. "
e4wa8pq;FromBayToBurg;1535366587.0;"Meanwhile in a dead forum from 2011: Why would anybody invest in the US markets?  Since 2000 international markets have outperformed the US.  I could have been so much richer had I just invested in the MSCI EAFE index for the last decade."
e4wewdl;ron_leflore;1535372124.0;"A long time ago, when many investment books were written, international stocks offered great diversification because markets were separate.  People in Japan bought things from Japanese companies, people in Germany bought things from German companies, people in the US bought things from US companies.  When a recession happened in Japan, it probably wasn't a recession in the US.This has changed over the past few decades.  Most modern markets are coupled.  Major companies sell their products throughout the first world.If you look at the top companies in an international fund, like VXUS, you'll see two things: companies that sell products you probably use everyday in the US (Toyota, Samsung, Nestle, Shell, Roche, TSMC) and Chinese companies (Tencent, Alibaba).The first category (Toyota, Samsung, Roche etc) are going to be highly correlated to the US stock market, because they sell into the same markets that US companies sell into.  So they offer little diversification these days.The second category (Alibaba, Tencent, etc)  contains significant risks due to VIE structure, accounting problems, and the lack of investor's rights in China--basically fraud.  I wouldn't touch it.So, I would stay away from the conventional international funds.  They don't offer diversification these days.  "
e4wylo0;jaghataikhan;1535405925.0;"I like Ben Carlson s analysis on this -http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2018/07/some-considerations-for-investing-globally/"
e4x5qzg;Eggs_is_eggs;1535412786.0;"Vanguard recently released a white paper where they predict that international returns will be higher than US returns for the next decade or so."
e4wz6g4;brookhaven_dude;1535406535.0;"Today most S&P 500 companies get a good chunk of their revenue from foreign markets. For example, just look at last time AAPL was having a hard time, it was mostly due to issues in China. So just investing in S&P 500 is enough for most people."
e4wat8e;SimplicityIsKing;1535367226.0;"Lol after reading the Bogleheads thread, it just proved that, "Nobody Knows Nothin.""
e4wq4gr;chak2005;1535393613.0;"> So, I would stay away from the conventional international funds. They don't offer diversification these days.You are probably going to have to better define your version of diversification, if you mean correlations between markets, those are not fixed and change on a [year by year basis](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&symbols=VTSMX+VGTSX&endDate=08%2F26%2F2018&timePeriod=1&numTradingDays=120) (click on the rolling correlations tab).Keep in mind, in a true crisis, all will correlate closely to 1.

e4x8xik;Wilfred_the_Hairy;1535415626.0;"VT is only about 10% emerging markets.At any rate, EM risks are presumably factored into the prices already.As far as developed goes, Iâ€™m glad to own a bit of companies like Novartis and Toyota.The US market is fairly tech heavy as well."
e4wpai2;gg_fin1;1535391814.0;"yeah right... because companies will be exactly the same in 10 years,15 years, 20 years /s"

e4xc5jr;jcaddy85;1535418423.0;"I'd agree, somewhat. The S&P 500 is full of global companies that happen to be based in the US, so it's not as if you don't have any international exposure like some would say. You're not going to get any small cap developed or emerging market exposure with the S&P 500 so I don't think it's truly enough."

9acisk;Questiongator;1535281215.0;"I was about taxes with trading accounts. What are the largest taxes and what are the ways most people lessen their effect?"

e4ugfg3;whoknowzz;1535283249.0;"Short term capital gains vs long term capital gains. Last thing you wana do is pay 10-15% higher rate"
e4ui728;userandaloser;1535285373.0;"Main way to lessen the tax effects of trading is not to trade—you only pay capital gains when you sell, and you pay far less if sell after holding for at least a year."
e4ukd6j;AlNOKEA;1535288219.0;"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/taxes/2017/12/22/your-guide-to-capital-gains-taxes-in-2018.aspxShort term gains are taxed as normal income. So if you make jack shit you would be in the 10% bracket. However, if your regular income and profit from flipped stocks exceeded $9.5k in a year it’d push you into the 12% bracketLong term gains are nice because they are kept seperate from your ordianry income. So since you probably live off ramen noodles and student loans you get taxed nothing due to having no income. All those sweet tendies are yours. "

e4v7ta0;kiwimancy;1535327410.0;"-Use tax sheltered accounts as much as possible (IRA, 401k, others).  -Put highly taxed assets like HY bonds and high turnover funds in sheltered accounts.  -Avoid realizing short term capital gains.  -Avoid realizing any capital gains.  -Realize capital losses (tax loss harvesting).

e4wi2pd;Questiongator;1535376885.0;"Ira vs 401k vs Roth?Also can these accounts be actively managed?"
e4x4wud;mastrgamr;1535412039.0;"IRA and 401K can both be Roth if you want. &#x200B;Roth is an option to contribute to those tax-advantaged accounts after your income tax is subtracted, based on your tax bracket. You can withdraw your contributions (not the gains) from Roth accounts tax free. 'Traditional' is the other option, which is when you get income taxed --based on your income tax bracket-- when you are able to withdraw from those accounts (usually at retirement age).&#x200B;They can be actively managed but it not recommended, the purpose is to leave the money in those accounts untouched... until retirement."
e4x6yka;kiwimancy;1535413873.0;"Most 401k plans have a limited selection of funds so you can't do individual stock selection in them, but you an use the actively managed funds on offer and you can actively move between broad asset classes. Some 401ks do offer a brokerage link option as well where you can invest in anything like you can in an IRA.  The choice of traditional vs roth depends on your current and future expected tax rates. That in turn depends on your salary progression as well as tax legislation. I do a mix of both because I don't know what my future holds. Roth IRAs are more flexible than traditional IRAs in some respects - you can take out contributions at any time, the income limits are higher, and you can do a backdoor roth later without being impeded by the pro rata rule.  Often you want to contribute to your 401k up to your employer's match, then to the IRA for finer control over your investments and sometimes lower costs, then back to the 401k once you hit the IRA max. HSA is also a great option which can be both sheltered from both income and capital gains taxes."

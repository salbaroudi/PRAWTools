9azjte;funnidesign;1535496569.0;"Hello guys, the current bull market in US has lasted for 7+ years. I wonder if any of you guys are concerned about a potential market crash in the near future or you simply don't care as it sounds impossible to time the market and picking quality stocks are far more important?For those of you who keep track of the global macro conditions, what indicators or tools do you usually use to keep track of macro market conditions? Do you guys build a market macro monitoring system by yourselves or are there any systems/tools out there in the market that blend indicators together?Look forward to hear your thoughts:) There are a lot of noises in the market and I am always keen in developing a systematic approach to understand market conditions but I must say it is challenging.EDIT: like most of you guys mentioned if anyone could correctly time the market he or she should get the Nobel prize! If I change my question by a little bit - do you guys still keep track of/value any market/economic indicators that help you make better asset allocation decisions? That they may not help us escape from a market crash but can still help us build a better risk adjusted portfolios?"

If anyone had a secret sauce you'd know by now. My best advice is to stay the course and if the market hits a downturn it hits a downturn. "

e4zcew2;big_deal;1535501717.0;"First, I'm not concerned about a market crash. Market crashes are part of investing. I fully accept that one can occur at any time without warning. If you can't survive a market crash it means you have too much risk exposure. Reduce your allocation to a point that a market crash doesn't cripple you financially or emotionally. Second, I want to say that I don't recommend using any of what follows to make investment decisions. It doesn't work well on "in-sample" data so it's probably worthless "out-of-sample". **Economic Model**I have built a recession probability model based on US economic data. I've never tried to extend it to any other countries but the US is 40% of global market cap so it has a lot of influence on every other market. If you want more detail I've posted it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7svdwh/market_correction/dt838ih/. **Valuation Model**You can find a ton of papers on using equity valuation (P/E, P/B, CAPE, etc) to predict future long term returns (5-10 years). A 10 year forecast doesn't really help you make an investment timing decision. Furthermore, even small errors in forecast compounded over 10 years can be a huge difference in outcome. However, such models can help you set appropriate expectations for future returns. Also, investing in assets/markets with low valuations doesn't help reduce emotional worry about your investment. It probably makes it worse because cheap assets tend to be surrounded by terrible news, be very volatile and tend to get even cheaper before they turn around. The odds that someone worried about a market at all time highs will actually stick with a shitty low valuation asset for 10 years is worse than a lottery ticket. "
e4z9jp6;atdharris;1535499240.0;"We need a catalyst in order to see a crash/bear market. In 2000 it was the dot com bubble and then 9/11. In 2007 it was the collapse of the housing market. Who knows what this time will be. No one can predict the crash and if they could, we'd all be selling now and waiting until the market drops. "

e4zv08x;RTiger;1535517391.0;"Listen for stock market conversation at social gatherings. At many major market tops, the stock market becomes a popular topic. This might include newbies asking about the market or worse is newbies bragging about huge profits. Even worse is people talking about quitting their good job to trade or retiring super early. Anecdotes are not data, but this can be a powerful indicator.Separately, strong up moves are sometimes the last gasp to get everyone on board. Look for up 10 percent in a month or up 30 percent in a year for SPY."

e4z9v38;atdharris;1535499514.0;"Could be. If I knew I would act accordingly. My philosophy when it comes to investing has not and won't change regardless. Buy what I understand, buy companies with good management and decent balance sheets and ones with large moats. Have 15-20% international exposure. Invest a fixed amount each month into whichever mutual fund I like. If the market drops, my approach won't change. Rarely can anyone, especially myself, time the market. I don't need my investments liquid anytime soon and the market will recover even if it does drop. "

e4zamqo;atdharris;1535500179.0;"I always have cash on hand in the event we do see a large drop. I bought some in February when we sold off. But I am not hoarding a ton of cash. Right now, my buys are companies that are not at all time highs. I've boosted my FB position after the drop. I bought CVS recently, which has been beaten up and trades cheap. I am not chasing high flying names by any means. I would not buy something like Amazon or Microsoft at these levels. But I can't predict when we will sell off. We need a catalyst that we don't have right now. If trade talks fail, that may be one. If there's another credit issue or rates rise more than expected, then maybe. But the market could rally another 10-20% before a 20-30% sell off. You just never know. I am confident in the companies I own aside from the ETFs and won't panic sell. "

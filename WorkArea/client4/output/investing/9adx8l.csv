9adx8l;lhdihodw;1535297758.0;"I am new to investing and I put a large amount in AT&T for its stability and dividends. After some days later, I can't get over the $6.95 commission charge per transaction and realizing I might be making a mistake.My reason to choose Merrill over Robinhood is safety. I've heard some stories where people lost their money in Robinhood and they had a hard time getting it back. Plus, the customer service is not the best. Merrill works well if you have a Bank of America account, especially for transfers. But their customer service is not as good as Vanguard's. I plan to make more investments into AMD and Microsoft but **trying to decide if it's smart to stick with Merrill edge or Robinhood?**I should say that I don't have an emergency fund because cause of recent expenses. So if a major issue comes up, I'll have to sell VGT and T to get some money. Slightly in a scary spot right now.So, **why is Merrill Edge (or other brokerage) better than Robinhood? Do you use them over Robinhood? Why?****What brokerage does everyone use?**"

e4uyvy6;B2rDe7A8V7;1535316785.0;"Most people use it, because it counts as a qualified BofA balance, which comes with very nice perks. For instance, your BofA Travel Rewards credit card effectively gives you a 2.6% cashback on all purchases if you have a BofA/ME balance of 100k. Somehow, I suspect that it's not the case with the OP."
e4v6uw3;atdharris;1535326439.0;"I'd only use it if you bank with BofA and have enough money to get free trades. If you do, then it's totally worth it to use Merrill over Robinhood. If you're just investing with a small amount, I'd stick with Robinhood or you'll get your profits eaten up by fees."
e4uxm5x;roochenz;1535314726.0;"I use Merrill because of the BoA affiliation, and the free trades I receive.  I’m not in love with the interface, but it gives me a single pane of glass for banking and brokerage."
e4uug67;doougle;1535308238.0;"I use TD Ameritrade mainly for the free use of thinkorswim."
e4uvyvt;Artmageddon;1535311633.0;"TBH I'm using Merrill Edge because I get 10 free trades with them per month but I don't think there's anything truly special or outstanding about it"

e4utnd1;SirGlass;1535306316.0;"I use schwab.Robinhood main drawback is it only supports taxable accounts.You should be Maxing out your IRA/401k or any tax sheltered accounts before investing in taxable a acounts "

e4v6yne;lhdihodw;1535326547.0;"Don't you need 25k or over to be eligible for 10 free trades? (In both Bank of America and Merrill Edge)?Are there other fees besides the commission that I am not aware of?"
e4v68me;tomgq;1535325794.0;"The thing to note here is you don’t even need an active account for this. Simply making a tda account and not even funding it gets you access to Thinkorswim. I use ToS for charting/screening/free CNBC stream etc but simply use Robinhood to trade."

e4uq2hp;lhdihodw;1535298070.0;"Do you use Robinhood?"
e4vng0u;B2rDe7A8V7;1535342639.0;"I don't like cashback on specific categories, especially rotating categories. I feel that it usually doesn't justify the effort, especially compared to a high-casback credit card, like Citi Double Cash. There is only so much gas you can buy.   Though 5.25% is pretty sweet, I don't think I have ever gotten 5.25% on anything. :)"
e4v730u;atdharris;1535326671.0;"You need at least $25k combined at BofA/Merrill. You could have $20k in your brokerage account and $5k in your checking and that would qualify. I don't pay any fees on trades for Merrill, but if you trade options, they are not commission free. I rarely do option trading."

e4ux0d1;enginerd03;1535313644.0;"That doesn't help your counterparty exposure to apex or the shitty app. Or the shitty customer service. Or the lack of ability to trade other asset classes or a million other reasons why any brand name brokerage is better. "

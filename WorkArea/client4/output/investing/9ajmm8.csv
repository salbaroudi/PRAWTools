9ajmm8;Dr_Fox1;1535351517.0;If a 2020 recession occurs, what individual stocks will you buy at/near the trough to hold long-term and maximize return?
9ajmm8;Dr_Fox1;1535351517.0;"I personally think we are about 2 years out from a major recession. I'm planning on investing a little bit into the S&P500 to build a foundation, but a significant portion into individual stocks that I believe will outpace the S&P500. I'm looking at $WM, $BA, $V, $T or $V and whichever casino looks the strongest and hasn't gone under. I'm just curious what stocks you guys are thinking about. Thanks for any advice!Edit: Omg I’m currently investing right now. Idk why some people are caught up about me guessing 2020. My question is: Next recession, what individual stocks will you be looking at?"

e4wcfma;ValenTom;1535369069.0;"Contrary to what r/investing believes, investing should be boring. AT&T returns consistent dividends every quarter and have increased them every year for decades. I gladly put money into this boring stock and was able to lock in 6.2% yearly dividend returns. When the next downturn hits, this sub will be singing a different tune as all their exciting stocks are tumbling back to realistic valuations. If you were here in January, you would have thought the world was coming to an end. The sub went from "Don't time the market ever! Always hold long! Always buy!" To people panic selling their positions in anticipation of a massive bear market. Don't get me wrong, I also invest in some "exciting" growth focused stocks, but those "boring" slow moving consistent companies deserve a place in everyone's portfolio."
e4w8yt7;billbixbyakahulk;1535365196.0;"I don't have a definitive answer but I do watch corporate and consumer debt, both of which are quite high.  But balancing that against current, still low, interest rates and employment numbers.  Delinquency rates are also [extremely low](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/chargeoff/delallsa.htm), which is another good sign.  Credit card delinquency rates are ticking up slightly but still not worrying for now.  What concerns me most is the more extended the economy gets with regards to credit, the more sensitive it becomes to flat or declining economic numbers. Coupled with a relaxing of credit standards it could start to become a problem.  I'm seeing small evidence of this, for example, with the GSEs relaxed lending rules for first time buyers.  As the consumer gets more maxed out, history teaches that more exotic and risky products will enter the market to keep the party going.  It always has a bad end.  If the Fed does their job and raises interest rates at a steady pace before fraud gets a "too big to fail" handcuff on the economy, we'll see flat or modest returns. If they again go on a road trip from San Francisco to NYC, and turn on the Tesla autopilot and call it a day, like Greenspan did, we're gonna have a bad time."

9agx7w;Unique_namest;1535330672.0;Good strategy for a stock I own that I think is stagnant or will drop?
9agx7w;Unique_namest;1535330672.0;"I own close to 100 shares of Intel.  I don't see a near future where this stock goes up (or maybe even up to a year or two).  At best o think it will stagnant.  More likely slowly decline.Should I simply sell off the stock?  Or play options, like selling covered calls, to maximize my gains?In parallel I think AMD is benefiting heavily from this stagnation from Intel and I think it will continue to do so.  But after last week's rally I don't know if it will go anywhere higher in the near term."

e4vcun5;SirGlass;1535332374.0;"Unless you have a good alternative that you are bullish on I would hold collect the dividend, and yes if you want to sell covered calls you could"
e4vciqa;its_the_og;1535332056.0;"I am in a similar boat on Intel. Thinking I'll just keep an eye on it for a week or two and see where it goes, to hopefully be able to get rid of it in the short term on a small profit or minimal loss.I don't expect it to go anywhere big up or down, but if AMD goes down a few percent this upcoming week, Intel may well go up in the short term too. I think a lot of people will sell AMD tomorrow, just because it exploded so much last week.The best scenario would be if AMD dips tomorrow and Intel goes up a bit. Then I'd sell Intel and consider buying some AMD, as you say they'll most likely go up in the long term if Intel keeps messing up."
e4viejb;doougle;1535337826.0;"If you want protection while maintaining upside, you could sell the stock and replace it with deep in the money LEAP calls.  Your downside is capped at the cost of the calls and the upside is unlimited.You can also sell nearer term calls against these LEAPS to reduce your max loss even more."
e4vlllp;eadamlevy;1535340882.0;"I am in the same boat with under armor (UA).  Should I sell now to have the write off.And if it doesn’t go up by February then just buy it back at it’s much lower rate.I like the stock long term but I don’t see it improving anytime soon.   "
e4w3acb;ScottishTrader;1535359064.0;"Be sure you have 100 shares and then sell covered calls OTM above the current stock price and your net cost if possible.Close for a profit, or roll for a credit, or let it expire and sell another one over and over staying ahead of any stock increase.  Be prepared to let the stock go If it pops up and is called from you, don’t try to save the shares as you can lose, let the shares be called away as you’ll make a nice profit.  You can either sell puts to be assigned more stock or just buy more outright if you want the shares.   "
e4vfby0;killerguppy101;1535334815.0;"You can either:1) Sell covered calls to reduce cost basis2) Sell, freeing up capital, and re-invest in something else that you think will provide a better ROI.If you really think it's just a short-term thing, and it will start to rise again soon (ie, they have a strong business and are poised to expand into new markets or technologies), then just hold on.  Especially if you've already held them to get capital gains taxes and you don't normally do short term trading.EDIT:as /u/SirGlass said, if you can also continue to hold for the dividend.  It depends on your risk tolerance and whether you think you have better opportunities with another company than this one (considering writing calls, dividends, taxes, etc).  Opportunity cost is a real thing, but it comes with a risk."
e4vlbsk;burcham82;1535340622.0;"Covered calls, if you think the stock could pull back sell them ITM. Normally you can get 1.5-3% unless it’s deep ITM. "
e4wb7gl;Unique_namest;1535367666.0;"New to selling options.  I've got 100 shares and know they can be called from me.What I don't know are exactly my options while selling calls.  If I sell a monthly OTM do I just sit there until it expires and do it again (provided it doesn't get called)?9/21 $49 go for $0.30.  not sure if it makes sense to sit on the stock for a month in return for $30?  I think I'm just super new to selling options."
e4vm7yw;Unique_namest;1535341474.0;"Hm.  Well I guess I don't expect it to do any better for maybe even the next two years?  All depends on where 10nm goes."
e4wcrux;bobskizzle;1535369468.0;"Yes, this is it exactly.I'm seeing $55 mid for that contract, which is ~ 14% annualized. (15.88% according to thinkorswim) Not a bad return for no downside risk on the contract (assuming it's actually covered)."
e4x0okx;ScottishTrader;1535408050.0;"Returns vary based on the stock and IV among other factors, but this is a low risk way to bring in some money, and it may be $30 at a time.  Be sure to look at this in the big picture of the cost and return on the stock, and that just sitting on a stock that is not moving is practically zero return.Many do sell 30 days to expire (DTE) as this brings in the better premium, then close if the option profits 50% or more to sell another one.  You do not have to wait until it expires.  Yes, if you can sell the stock and use the cash for another more profitable trade then do it.  "

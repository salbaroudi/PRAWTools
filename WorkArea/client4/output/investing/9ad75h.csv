9ad75h;AR131313;1535288265.0;"I am a late 20s investor so I don’t need the security that CDs provide but I am looking to allocate a small amount to building a CD ladder in case there is a downturn coming in the next year or two. My question is a what yield would you begin to consider a CD? With inflation being 2-3% I can’t see a reason to ever get a CD less than 4%. As rates are still expected to increase several more times in the coming years this is not something I would consider for at least another year. Just looking to gather more perspective. "

Sure, with a 2% CD you might be losing money in real terms, but you'd be losing 2% more if you're just sitting on cash.If you don't need the cash in the next few years, then no, there is absolutely no point in getting CDs. If you're trying to hedge against an economic downturn, you're better off going with 30-year T bonds or a money market fund."

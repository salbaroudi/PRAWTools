9af1k4;georgge13;1535313729.0;"Hi, I've been buying company shares through the employee share plan and I'm leaving the company soon. I'd like to hold on to my shares and the only option I have is to transfer it to a UK broker account (or sell) - any advise you can share would be appreciated - I'm planning to hold the stocks for a minimum of 9 months and they're traded in FRA exchange.&#x200B;Any recommendation on which platform is the best when it comes to fees and ease to use  or any other option would be appreciated. "

I know I have been in a situation where I'm forced to either sell or open a trading account with them. In my situation where it is probably different then yours, if I planned to sell the shares they charged a 50% fee/Commission for it."

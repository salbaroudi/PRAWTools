9a8ves;firebyrealestate;1535249799.0;"TNDM has nice pull back yesterday, planning to take more (deep dive) on Monday if it falls again. Before taking more, just wanted to share the details.I recently came across this TNDM Stock. It went down from peak $300 to as low as $5 (I think reverse split happened), now recovered to $38.Some of the positives:* They are the lowest mcap of all competitors like MDT, DXCM, PODD* They floated secondary offer, got 115M and paid off their debt $94M (appx) have excess 20M for operation cash flow. This diluted shares at $28.5, but jumped to $38 now.* Got FDA approval recently for T:Slim products, commercialization started since Aug 2018 onwards. They are able to make a software to work with DXCM products* Year over year sales improved, and making losses, but losses getting narrowed.* With debts removed by follow on, and having slightly excess cash for operations, there is likely turn around profit by end of this year.* These equipment is life saving / extending category and Continuous Glucose Monitoring technology is important. Type 1 diabetes market is increasing.* Institutional holdings are appx 62%Some of the negatives:* If competitors like MDT or DXCM or any other makes similar product, in next 6 months, sales may get impact.* Even though TNDM made some break through, they are no match (in sales) against MDT , the biggest challenger* Cash burn must be stopped by increase in sales which is one or two years away.* Skeptical/scared because of the way it jumped from $5 to $35 (bit follow on offer was 28.5 subscribed nicely)​Here is the link for analysis purpose[https://api.marketrealist.com/api/serie/2018/08/what-does-tandems-valuation-trend-indicate/pdf](https://api.marketrealist.com/api/serie/2018/08/what-does-tandems-valuation-trend-indicate/pdf)​**For TNDM what can go wrong or Challenges on this stock before going heavy on this stock?**&#x200B;"

e4tqzc6;Copper9125;1535256175.0;"I wouldn’t consider DXCM a competitor since they makes CGMs while TNDM makes insulin pumps. I also thought DXCM was working with TNDM on a closed loop system (artificial pancreas)"

e4u2jcl;bcrew;1535268158.0;"TNDM is a great company with a great product. The only negative I would present to you is they are really expensive trading at almost 12x 2019 sales. For perspective other high growth stocks in medical device trade around 10x and small caps trade around 5-6x. It's basically priced for perfection right now and and small hiccup can hit the stock pretty hard. Great company to own but buying at these leaves is tough to justify. "

No idea when UHC will reinstate coverage for $TNDM products. The valuation of $TNDM should include the market share captured from $JNJ leaving the space and a $MDT conversion rate.Looking forward to future CCs..."

e4tpd3d;CDRCRDS;1535254534.0;"Well Mannkind is due for $mnkd upside potential similar to $tndmso if you need to rebalance shave 1/3 and take 1/3 of that third to $mnkd and expect the same explosive development November October.$Tndm will inevitably reach $50 but not without some tribulations.remember to balance your portfolios on explosive growthFor instance last winter I held $CGC $ACB and shorted $amdhowever as I covered $amd in feb and went long I had shaved enough off the highs that got in low enough to double my pot gains.goodluckthis isnt advice just anecdotal."
e4trzkh;firebyrealestate;1535257193.0;"I agree that they are likely partner for TNDM than a competitor.Since they are in the same field, they can also create similar product and install unless TNDM has a tie-up contract with them.The biggest player/Competitor is MDT and in fact TNDM is taking their share of market.I am positive on TNDM making a progress next two quarters as **they become financially secure stage** getting rid of debt.Holding long term, esp 5 to 10 years time frame, needs more in depth analysis which I really lack at present."

9b19ha;matty1monopoly;1535508544.0;"Other than expense ratio (which I believe IVV, VOO are both 0.04% and SPY is 0.09%) is there any reason why one of these would be better than the other?Even their 1, 3, & 5 year annual returns are within fractions of a percent to one another.SPY - 18.49%, 13.28%, 12.06%IVV - 18.51%, 13.32%, 12.11%VOO - 18.48%, 13.35%, 12.13%Dividends don't seem to be too far off either.SPY - 1.69%IVV - 1.70%VOO - 1.73%It would seem just based on the numbers alone that VOO is the clear winner with highest dividend and highest 3 and 5 year annual returns. I'm more of an SPY guy myself but I'd be interested to hear if anyone has a good reason on why to pick one of these over another."

e4zmd0k;AcademicGuest;1535510128.0;"The main reason you would want one over the other is if it's free through your brokerage. IVV is free if your at Fidelity, similar for VOO from Vanguard, not sure about SPY though."
e4znjhz;ChE_from_VT;1535511116.0;"SPY is really only useful for liquidity. If the market implodes fast youll have a harder time selling VOO or IV at the price you want. Also, options traders don't write or buy contracts as heavily for IVV and VOO. SPY options are also highly liquid."
e4zl1zl;Imadeadpeople;1535509030.0;"Got me some VOO. Been doing well."
e4zli2t;neocoff;1535509412.0;"Thanks OP. What's the fees on those? "
e4zllrb;amy31415;1535509497.0;"SWPPX is technically cheapest ETF (ETA: per below, SWPPX is MuFu - probably should've noticed by ticker!). Fidelity recently launched no-ER mutual funds like FZROX which should almost very closely correlate to SP500 performance (but need account with them).SPY has the most volume. This doesn't really matter to any normal person; VOO and IVV at least (probably Schwab option, too, I've just never looked at it) have many multiples more than enough volume to not move on retail investor trades, with very tight spreads."
e504500;ServerOfJustice;1535525537.0;"All three are free to trade at Vanguard. "
e4zm1dr;ServerOfJustice;1535509859.0;"> SWPPX is technically cheapest ETF afaik. Except that SWPPX isn't an ETF but yes it's the cheapest S&P 500 fund I'm aware of."
e4zs7yl;SirGlass;1535515047.0;"SCHX although doesn't follow the S&P500 it follows a similar index that is 99% correlated has a .03% expense ratio."

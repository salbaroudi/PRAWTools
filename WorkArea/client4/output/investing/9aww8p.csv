9aww8p;BrewRs;1535470429.0;"Anyone interested/invested in Libya?GDP growth of 55% last year apparently... Likely tied to the oil industry of course."

e4yqtrc;persianbluex;1535474810.0;"Failed state"
e4yrh21;EmployerOfTheMonth;1535476295.0;"I doubt anyone in this sub knows shit about the Libyan economy and would be interested in investing there. Anyway you need to do more research rather than just looking at one gdp figure"
e4ysfsu;arruacas;1535478460.0;"It grew 55% because it's basically coming from zero. And as someone already pointed out, GDP growth does not imply investment returns, because even though the overall economic output increased, the major publicly traded companies may lose valuation.  If anything you could look at what companies are doing resource extraction and try to go from there. But even then, if they aren't foreign companies, you will still be facing price fluctuations relative to commodity prices and such. It's kinda complicated."

e4yup8r;Wizard_Sleeve_Vagina;1535482940.0;"As a general rule, investing in developing economies requires a lot more due diligence. "

9b1h3v;marcus55;1535510049.0;"Hi Guys,I would ask this on the UK investing subreddit, but seems quite dead over there.I'm going to look into if I want to get some Aston Martin shares, but before I do a deep dive into its financials properly I thought I'd check how I would even go about getting them if I came to the conclusion I want to invest.Any idea if its just the usual process, or is there anything I need to be aware of or need to do to purchase the stock?I'm assuming it's just going through your normal broker, but any comments would be appreciated!Thanks all :)"

e4zmnov;duzza275;1535510374.0;"Are you based in the UK?"
e4zowvk;WizOnTheFence;1535512270.0;"Wait for IPO on London Stock exchange and buy stock. If you are a sophisticated investor, try to buy someones shares before IPO. If you don’t have those connections ask your broker for shares of the IPO. If you can’t get that, wait. "

You can pick up shares on the secondary market after but they'll be at a huge mark up.Personally I'm sceptical of an IPO of a company that isn't likely to have huge growth prospects. Well established industries like cars tend to not have much room for jaw dropping growth."

e4zntts;marcus55;1535511353.0;"haha now that is definitely something they should consider!"

e50dh0l;ramuscl;1535534502.0;"Luxury cars are a different beast than your average commuting car.  Ferrari's stock has done very well since the IPO.  I'm not familiar with Aston Martin's business but I wouldn't write them off solely because they manufacture cars."
e504toy;duzza275;1535526165.0;"Then should be fairly straightforward. Wait for IPO then buy shares on whichever, relatively large, broker you use (e.g. HL, IG, etc.)I haven't heard any news so far that would indicate otherwise.&#x200B;Hope this helps and good luck :)"

9appwh;Fearthethrash;1535411340.0;Need advice for choosing portfolios
9appwh;Fearthethrash;1535411340.0;"Hello, I’m a new investor looking for help on choosing a conservative or aggressive portfolio. Here’s a little background of me and my financial situation. I am currently 18 years old still living with my parents. I have a job that pays me approximately 700 after taxes biweekly. I don’t have really have any debts or bills to because I live with my parents. However, I still pay little stuff like gas and groceries but it never takes more than 50 percent of my check. So with that out of the way, my current earnings as of now is .87 percent with a gain of .86 cents. It’s probably important to mention that I’m using acorns, which is a app that manages your portfolio based on what you pick. For example, a conservative portfolio is 40 percent government bonds, another 40 for corporate bonds, 12 percent large company stocks, 4 percent intl Large companies, and the last 4 percent split between real estate and company stocks. Aggressive is 40 large company stocks, 20 small company stocks, 20 intl large, and 20 split between emerging market stocks and real estate. I invested exactly 99.99 and my balance now is 100.87 it’s nothing too big, but it’s something that makes me happy to see I’m gettin  money for literally doing nothing. I’m wondering if I should add more money let’s say in the thousands would A great time to buy? VOO and VB  are the main stocks in the aggressive portfolio and I’ve seen they been doing really good the past year( even hitting all time highs according to yahoo finance) . However would it be best if I wait until the next correction or go conservative?"

You have a job, but you're not making a ton of money.  This means you are in a low tax bracket.  Because you have (assumedly) W-2 earned income, and are in a low tax bracket, you should be pumping money into a Roth IRA.  Money that goes into a Roth will never be taxed again, **and neither will any gains it makes**.Let's do math:$700/biweekly, is about $18200.  Half of that (bills) is $9100.  Max contribution for a Roth IRA is $5500.  So it wouldn't even take up all your money to max out a Roth IRA.Now, why would you want to do that?  Because right now, you have the single most important thing on your side - TIME.VOO basically mirrors the S&P 500.  The S&P 500 has averaged a 9.8% rate of return over the last 90 years.  It's done better recently, done worse in the nearish past, but it averages close to 10% over long periods of time.If you were to put away $5500 this year, and every year going forward, to retirement, you would save $258,500 over 47 years.And it would be worth about $5 million.  And that's not a bad way to retire.Now, remember when I said you should consider more risk?  If you could find something that would net more like 14% (not a huge difference, right?), after 47 years, you'd be sitting on $21 million.tl;dr - open a Roth IRA, fund it, then invest those funds.  Take on higher-risk/higher-reward if it makes sense (this does NOT mean crypto...it means sectors that can grow inordinately well).  Be consistent over time, and you will win.Money isn't happiness; it's choices/options.But it's sure nicer to cry in a Lexus than a Camry.Just for your research - compare VOO to other things, like VGT.Also, here's the calculator I used - https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator(disclosure - I am 99% VGT and VITAX, with a few shares of VCR and like one share of VEA.)"

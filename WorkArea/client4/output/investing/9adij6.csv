9adij6;jessiejames417;1535292121.0;"I feel like it’s been too good to be true so far. "

e4uneq8;StockLesner;1535292944.0;"Total speculation at this point. Really, it comes down to your approach. If you're long on marijuana stocks, I'd say get it now, cost average and build position. All of these stocks have years ahead of them until the major players develop. I'd say $CRON and $CGC are decent bets given current news. "
e4unsxd;jessiejames417;1535293634.0;"These are the first two companies I’ve ever invested in. I bought $1000 worth in each company on the 14th of August and I think I should sell on Monday. Take a step back and do some more research and some reading. I don’t really know what I’m doing and I think I’ve got pretty lucky. "
e4uwtpi;Nildrem;1535313304.0;"Do not touch weed stocks unless you can handle a 30% or more drop in a week also, it goes both ways."
e4ux9vc;neve1064;1535314126.0;"I shorted STZ so many times thinking it has to go down because it’s been on a run for too long.  That was back at $80. I watched that stock go from $13 to $200.  I think the lesson here is to study the market’s behavior LATELY. Look at the run up of TWTR back in April and again last month. Several stocks ran hard, longer than expected like TSLA because people see the future and pay handsomely for it.  I think EVERYONE knows weed is the future and Constellation Brands has already done the research for you by selecting CGC. My play on this is simple: write cash secured puts at every drop no matter how small the drop because the payout was huge for the quick drop it did last week for a few minutes. Since everyone believes in CGC and the RATE of rise is at a fast clip, ANY drop is perceived as “ oh this is where it retraces 50% because it’s too good to last” and the payout is huge. Also, look at what CGC used to be called: TWMJF. See the way it acted and you’ll see several people here are exactly correct.  It’s volatile.  But, and this is big, having STZ buy into you like they’ve done, it’s a game changer and I think people are looking at the rise of STZ over the last 8 years and wondering if this could happen to CGC too now. Writing CSPs, You won’t capture as much as going long but at least you’re protected a bit and if you do get assigned, it will likely bounce up again after a drop. YMMV. Not to name drop but tomorrow I’m having cigars and Scotch with someone who reports directly to Richard Sands.  I’ll be asking him what he’s heard about their thoughts on stock price action. "
e4uot4g;jessiejames417;1535295525.0;"Yeah I don’t think this is how it’s supposed to work. Like if I knew I could put in $1000 and make almost $500 in over a week then why didn’t I do this years ago? "

e4ux2my;jessiejames417;1535313760.0;"Okay. Thanks for letting me know. I guess my question for right now is how long does anyone foresee it rising? "
e4upiju;JustCallMeAtom;1535296914.0;"These are volatile stocks. You should consider how much you think the companies are worth before buying or selling the stock. "
e4uusb5;unsung_pleb;1535309038.0;"that is not how it works, you could easily go down 35%, you entered at a good time. But don't fool your self into thinking it's always up up and up."

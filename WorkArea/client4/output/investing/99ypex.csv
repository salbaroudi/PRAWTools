99ypex;GarcolinoMastor;1535155677.0;"Hey everyone! I'm 19 and currently in uni, i have some money saved up (around 500 euros) and i'm gonna have more next year since i'm taking a summer job. I wanna learn AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE about investing as i think its gonna be the solution for me to have a decent financial life since i'm thinking of following a scientist/academic career which won't really make me alot of money but will bring me fullfilment in life. So, which books do you guys recommend? I'm not looking for the 0.001% that made it, im trying to find the best way to guarantee a good financial future. Thank you so much for even reading this far! :D"

e4rf0om;harrison_wintergreen;1535157288.0;">im trying to find the best way to guarantee a good financial futurenot exactly an investing book, but *Stop Acting Rich* by Thomas Stanley is the best overall financial book I've ever read. he was a finance professor, and found that people who are actually rich (lots of investments/money in the bank) *do not* live a fancy, high-end lifestyle. in fact, people who live fancy, extravagant lifestyles tend to be broke or skint -- they might have a high income, but low savings. all their income goes into expensive cars, shoes, clothes, etc. they don't have a lot to save and invest. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Acting-Rich-Start-Living-Millionaire/dp/1118011570/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1535128473&sr=8-1&keywords=stop+acting+rich"

Don't get me wrong, many great classic books are out there (The Intelligent Investor, Essays of Warren Buffet); however, the level of investing you indicated suggests you would be more inclined to a passive or low management form of investing. I'm also 19 and I live in the US, so I'm unfamiliar with what type of investments are readily available to you. If possible, set up a Roth IRA or some type of retirement plan (I have a TSP, which is through the US Government). Many are uncertain of its' future, but check out cryptocurrency. Research stocks, Lending Clubs, ETFs, Mutual Funds, these are all things to research online. Good luck to you in your endeavors. P.S. you could use the money you didn't spend on the books lol"

e4rp572;TheNextFaker;1535165771.0;"While I agree with you for the most part, I think it varies from person to person. For instance, Bill Gates owns a $125M house and is still rich, Floyd Mayweather/Connor McGregor wear fancy clothes/jewlery and still have a lot of money (granted they may have to fight again to make more money or in the case of Floyd run his business).​The scale of rich probably plays a factor here too. For example, if you consider someone with $3M net worth rich, then yeah if you try to live a super fancy lifestyle your money will run out fast. But if you're talking $10-100B net worth rich, then you can for sure live a fancy lifestyle without realistically worrying all that much.&#x200B;Ofc, most people can only hope to become millionaire rich, so what you said definitely should hold true for a vast majority of the population."

Once you have the experience of gains and losses, I think reading a book can help cement what it was that you did right or wrong.​I don't think you can really learn if all you do is read to learn how to make the right moves. Take me for example. I was only starting off by trading stocks and I was making good returns. 12% returns per month. Then I heard of options and how crazy the profits were. At that point all I knew about options was that it was risky and that I should only do it with money I'm willing to lose. I lost 300 dollars. Guess what I did while anxiously hoping I can salvage some of that money? I decided to read up gammas. The difference between puts and calls. IVs. Etc. For me, the experience was the impetus for learning. Not the other way around."

Obviously you tend to all your needs and that of those important to you first, but then it's up to the individual to decide what to do with the rest. If these things make you happy, and you are financially capable of affording them (including having enough for retirement), then why not? Some people may find joy in racking up a net worth, while others may find more joy in just using it."

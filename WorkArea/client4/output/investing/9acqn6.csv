9acqn6;jep777;1535283334.0;"So I wrote a little program that finds the fair stock value using the following:(Enterprise Value - Total Debt) / Shares Outstanding = Fair Stock ValueWhat are your thoughts (pros and cons) of investing in "undervalued" stocks this way?"

e4ujra6;kiwimancy;1535287423.0;"What's the difference between that and market price?"
e4ugr13;eskjcSFW;1535283620.0;"Make sure it's not a value trap first"
e4uqm89;CanYouPleaseChill;1535299229.0;"The program would give you rubbish results. In essence, you're just subtracting cash from the market value of the common stock.To estimate a stock's intrinsic value, you need to make the appropriate adjustments to earnings to better reflect the economic reality of the company, and then discount these at an appropriate rate."
e4uzz1n;doodle77;1535318338.0;"That would value a company losing money the same as one making money."
e4v9f61;LucasCritique;1535329052.0;"This formula does not tell you the intrinsic value of a stock. Only discounting future earnings (+net tangible assets) and dividing by shares outstanding can do that. "
e4ukgr0;jep777;1535288343.0;"Depends on the stock.  For example, Amazon closed at $1905 but this formula suggest a fair value for one share of AMZN is $1826.  So, AMZN is overvalued by these metrics.edit: I should point out that the shares outstanding are based on quarterly reports I believe"
e4ugufb;jep777;1535283729.0;"How would I determine that?"
e4urefc;jep777;1535300976.0;"Is there a particular formula you can point me to? I'm going off a discounted cash flow valuation based on what I've read on investopedia. This is not my field of expertise"
e4vo1k2;Give_Praise_Unto_Me;1535343212.0;"You're not even trying anymore with the usernames"
e4ukj7i;kiwimancy;1535288427.0;"Where does the difference come from? Isn't EV just equity plus debt? And then you subtract debt to get back the market price. I'm not very knowledgeable about finance."
e4uslxa;Throwawayacct449393;1535303810.0;"No way to do it really. You have to use qualitative analysis, as in, understanding the business to see if it is viable or does it have serious issues at hand. Read the latest 10-k and listen to the last earnings conference call."
e4uu7z8;hedgefundaspirations;1535307697.0;"> I'm going off a discounted cash flow valuation based on what I've read on investopedia. No you are absolutely not. Go to macabacus.com and learn how to do an actual discounted cash flow model is you actually want to learn."
e4uz2y3;CanYouPleaseChill;1535317082.0;"If you're serious about learning to value businesses, pick up *Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond* by Bruce Greenwald. He starts by teaching you to value a company based on its assets, then by earnings power value, as well as how to correctly account for growth. It has real case studies of companies like WD-40 and Intel, and also talks about how to factor competitive advantage into your analysis."
e4ul7xz;jep777;1535289411.0;"I'm learning myself, this is based on a Discounted Cash Flow valuation.  without debt EV is market value of common stock + market value of preferred equity + minority interest - cash and investments.The difference in price is what someone is willing to pay for it.[https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/corporate-finance/3/discounted-cash-flow/introduction.aspx](https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/corporate-finance/3/discounted-cash-flow/introduction.aspx)"
e4v2krc;jep777;1535321702.0;"Thanks, I'll check it out"
e4v28iu;kiwimancy;1535321287.0;"The market value of common stock is what someone is willing to pay for it.  This doesn't look like a DCF. There's no cashflows or discounting."

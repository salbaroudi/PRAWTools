9av96j;RecyclopsPolluticorn;1535453185.0;"I've invested recently in a very volatile stock.  Because it bounces around so much, I am thinking of setting up limit orders $1 apart.  I would like a website or app that would allow me to set my buy and sell parameters into it and then use it historically to see how many times I would have bought and sold, like over the past week.  Does anyone know where I can find something like this?"

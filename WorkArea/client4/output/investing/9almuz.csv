9almuz;Cyberme4u;1535369093.0;"Article on BBC.com suggest that investors (https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-45275461/the-virtual-land-selling-for-millions) are spending real money to buy land in a new city that only exists in virtual reality. Buyers are able to build whatever they want on their designated plots in "Decentraland". Many hope to make a profit trading goods and services in the virtual world's own crypto currency. Interesting indeed."

e4wjnxc;Throwawayacct449393;1535379695.0;"I guess it does have potential if it is similar to second life. Second life did grow to be quite large and had an economy of a few hundred million from what I've read. I think it does have potential if some sort of legitimate use can be made from it. I don't really know what that would be but people always have creative ways of making money or buying/selling goods and services.&#x200B;"

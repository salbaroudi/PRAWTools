9aq02b;throwaway2676767;1535413250.0;"I have some spare cash and was thinking about getting into trading. Most of my money will go into safe options like ETFs, but I would like to play around with options trading using a small amount of money. I don't plan on doing it until I learn (a lot) more. I'm also planning on applying to trading firms following university, so knowledge in these areas would be a considerable benefit to my application.I'm a mathematics major in university and I've also done a fair bit of statistics courses, so I would appreciate books that have a more advanced mathematical component, in addition to books that are mainly conceptual.â€‹"

To be fucking clear, that sub isn't WSB and if you don't understand risk management (read: if you gamble!), you will be called out and made fun of.

9b00cl;GopherFawkes;1535499888.0;Best Buy sales in second quarter best in 15 years; company raises forecast
9b00cl;GopherFawkes;1535499888.0;"Stock is down over 6%, can someone explain? Everyone likes to talk about market acting irrational with TSLA all the time, but I have seen quite a bit of irrational reaction this earnings season, what gives?"

e4zg7tp;anciar;1535504916.0;"Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) on Tuesday reported a drop in quarterly online sales growth and offered a profit forecast for the current quarter that fell short of analyst estimates, sending its shares down more than 7 percent in late morning trading. "
e4zbtdh;someroastedbeef;1535501199.0;"estimates are for analysts. people who actually move the market like hedge funds/mutual funds etc have their own benchmarks that they want to see hit and it probably wasn't impressive to themdon't worry if you're a long. BBY loves to tank after a great quarter and then climb back up slowly. has literally happened the last 5 quarters"
e4zenv3;bro-away-;1535503605.0;"I'll give my armchair opinion.​Amazon, Target, and Walmart are all up a lot in the last year and are all seen as companies that can do what BB can do and more.  Theres been a lot of fear in specialized super stores lately and Toys/Babies R US dying doesn't exactly instill confidence.  BB has a pretty diverse offering but I still see them as in direct competition with companies booming even more."

e4zj5xt;lazyboredandnerdy;1535507432.0;"They had lower than expected online growth and has a lower than expected forecast for the rest of the year.Analysts/investors don't care as much about one good quarter when management comes out and says things aren't going to be that good going forward.Edit: Spelling mistake"
e4zy4bv;mgr86;1535520057.0;"I'll share an anecdotal story. I made my first BB purchase in about 15 years the other week. They have had several great deals on a particular external harddrive. This drive is easily shuckable (converted to an internal drive). The sales are quite popular and people on /r/DataHoarder claim to pick up 5+ at a time. I wonder if this has anything to do with it. "
e4zyxdn;seymorebuttcoin;1535520758.0;"Nearly half of all trading volume is driven by algos. If no one knows what goes into them in making decisions no sense trying to explain anything in short term price trading. That’s in addition to all MM’s who, as noted above, have their own benchmarks and data they are making moves based on. People can give answers that sound better than others. But really it’s just hindsight guessing. No one knows for sure. "
e4zx6i3;MinusKaos;1535519256.0;"I was surprised they were up over 80. I think people were just just riding the train. Earnings gave them a reason to correct. "
e4zxwr0;Account_Admin;1535519881.0;"My financial advisor has banned me from entering a Best Buy or using Amazon. "
e50ab1q;Silver5005;1535531468.0;"It was priced for perfection, like 90% of stocks our there today.  How is that confusing exactly?"
e50btvn;advanceman;1535532947.0;"I bought calls."
e50fnyg;sraperez;1535536560.0;"Best Buy fucking sucks. I know their game. They got beaten half to death by Amazon for not price matching, so then all of the sudden they came out with a big "we price match" campaign to lure people in, but lo and behold, they started buying from as many obscure no name vendors as possible who weren't advertising on Amazon, just so you couldn't price match, in practice. Not only that, but anyone with even remote knowledge about electronics won't shop at Best Buy unless it's an absolute last resort (i.e. forgot to pack my phone charger and now I need one right the fuck now for my rental car's Android Auto function, type situation). Their computer/phone/TV/hard drive selection is a mess, with the lowest tear specs possible, their "product specialists" roaming around the store don't know any more about the device in questions than what can be found cruising Tech Radar for 5 minutes while on the shitter, and their Geek Squad has been caught red handed committing fraud. /r/offmychest"
e503wl6;Fy15412cf3;1535525324.0;"Walked into one recently and bought a new computer. Would never make a major electronics purchase online. Electronics are a great opportunity for retail to keep up sales in the modern economy imo, and Best Buy is the clear leader."

e4ziprp;slightlyintoout;1535507062.0;"> Online sales growth in the quarter of 10.1% slowed sharply compared to the year ago growth rate of 31.2%.Who realistically thought 31.2% annual growth was sustainable? 10.1% growth in most businesses isn't bad.edit: for some context, I think online sales in general are growing around 15% year to year. So 31% is fantastic, because it meant that they were taking online market share from other online retailers. On the flipside, this is why 10% growth is so disappointing (but would be good in most other businesses). They lagged overall online sales growth."
e4zse9t;Ry-Fi;1535515194.0;"Yup -- there is an article about it on the front page of WSJ.com. I swear half the posters here don't do any research before posting questions."
e506iqu;unpluggedcord;1535527770.0;"so buy the dip then?"
e4zh9db;thisguy1111;1535505834.0;"BB is really banking hard on their Geek Squad. Those 3 don't have an equivalent I don't think?"
e4zg8rv;GopherFawkes;1535504941.0;"But why the drop after earnings and a good one at that, everything you mentioned was known before today. I got no position with BBY but just find how the market weird, and it's not only this stock, just used this stock as an example, but this whole earnings season been irrational for a lot of stocks."
e509u45;AestheticKing;1535530943.0;"Just my personal experience:I’ve been an amazon prime member for years. To the point where I won’t even go to Walmart on my drive home from work anymore because Amazon is so convenient.One place I always make sure to go to though is Best Buy.The reason is they price match amazon. So I can get what I want “on demand” so to speak. The 2nd reason is their rewards system.I am now an elite plus which gives me a 45 day return window and every dollar I spend gets me a lot more in store points that I routinely redeem for cash off my purchases.Then once you hit elite plus they next day ship you items from their website at no extra charge and in turn you get more points for more coupons.And their product selection is pretty diverse. Especially online. Edit: let me add to that.They also ALWAYS have deals on phones and tablets. They slightly vary from the ones at carrier stores in terms of pricing/bundles/discounts/BOGO’s but that’s a whole ‘nother avenue of revenue for them.I got an iPad Pro 12.9 from them recently because they had a better deal than my carrier and also included a discount on a high end case of it of my choosing. "
e4zvjnv;ticklishmusic;1535517853.0;"a potential explanation: best buy has done a good job making it attractive to go to a store and shop, especially with all the appliances and other stuff they have. generally, the nature of the goods and services they sell are those you want to try before you buy. people use the website to browse and will order/ buy some things online, but many go into the store and ask questions and poke around before committing to buying a new fridge or other big ticket items.​i'm gonna add to my position anyways."

I’ve only met one nice and helpful geek squad employee. I hate generalizing, but I meet a lot of different BB (& Geek Quad) employees and this has been my experience. Sorry for this tangent. "

e4zgz73;Unanimous_Anonymity;1535505593.0;"I can't comment specifically on this situation because I havent been following, but Ill offer an example. If all of best buys competitors are showing sales increases of 10% but best buy only shows a sales increase of 5% this can be a telling sign that best buy is losing out to competitors. Yeah maybe they beat all expectations but if competitors beat by even more there has to be a negative reason for why best buy wasnt able to achieve the same. And as we know the market takes into account future performance as well as current performance "

Analysts rarely, if ever, have a cohesive opinion about the future of an organization and thus the company's own guidance is the primary factor in determining "expectations" that this user is probably seeing. The fact boils down to investors wanting to see some metric that the company failed to provide. In this case, online sales. Best Buy's online sales fell, so the stock fell. "

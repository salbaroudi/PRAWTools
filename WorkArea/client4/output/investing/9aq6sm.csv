President EPN says no deal without Canada.This whole thing is still up in the air and no one seems to be on the exact same page as to what will happen.>Trump threatened he still could put tariffs on Canadian-made cars if Canada did not join its neighbors and **warned he expected concessions on Canada’s dairy protections**.Canada already offered concessions but no deal was reached. Canada will not allow the [43 million gallons of tax payer subsidized milk US producers dump down the drain](https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-dairy-farmers-dump-43-million-gallons-of-excess-milk-1476284353) to be dumped in the Canadian market.>The United States relented on its demand for an automatic expiration for the deal, known as a “sunset clause.”>Instead, the United States and Mexico agreed to a 16-year lifespan for the deal, with a review every six years that can extend the pact for 16 years, U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer said.So sunset clause goes from 5 years to 16 years. [Canada won't agree to any sunset clause](https://globalnews.ca/video/4352269/canada-remains-strongly-opposed-to-sunset-clause-in-nafta-freeland).>Mexico agreed to eliminate dispute settlement panels for certain anti-dumping cases, a move that could complicate talks with Canada, which had insisted on the panels.Another sticking point.>“I think with Canada, frankly, the easiest we can do is to tariff their cars coming in. It’s a tremendous amount of money and it’s a very simple negotiation. It could end in one day and we take in a lot of money the following day,” Trump said.He still doesn't get it.

Was this a necessary risk? Depends who you ask. But if we progress our trade agreements and the US “wins” then Trump is still gonna try his best to fuck something else up before he leave office. Or maybe he’ll count his lucky stars he got away with the trade wars, possibly colluding, paying off a pornstar and he’ll just pardon all of his buddies and leave quietly.

It doesn’t erase all the terrible things he has done and will do, but I will gladly give him credit if he pulls it off. I said the same thing with the North Korea deal, which seemed promising and had all this pomp, yet is currently going nowhere. Or the big tax deal, which was advertised as being amazing for the middle class, but has been nothing but a tax breaks for corporations with no wide ranging positive impact for the middle class and a recent announcement of an awful government deficit because they had no good way to pay for it. Results are all that matter, positive or negative. If they get this done and it actually helps the average American that’s great. But you saying the S&P could take off, that’s the kind of crap that annoys the hell out of me. It’s like people that think the DOW is an indication of economic health.  99% of Americans don’t make their living based on how the S&P does, and it blowing through the roof isn’t helping me really. My 401K May improve, but even with that I need long term growth and improvement. If it’s a short term bump but has underlying issues that make problems down the road, it’s not helpful. Anyway, we will see. I seriously dislike Trump for a mountain of reasons. But I’ve said from the start that my dislike doesn’t mean I want him to fail. Obama, Bush, Trump, wanting any of them to fail is stupid since the failure of our government only hurts us. I hope Trump knocks it our of the park.

I’m sure you’ll reply with some snarky anti-trump comment, but if you actually believe NK relations are not better than they’ve been in decades you are in the minority opinion in America. This Mexico trade deal will most likely not be “inked” over night. Such an expectation would be unrealistic and not even the most energetic trump supporter would suggest that. However, like the NK deal, we are expecting trade relations with Mexico to improve, and if you actually follow actions instead of editorial, you will most likely see that improvement happen.

The important action here is that satellite imagery suggests they’re dismantling a site which is used to produce liquid fuel engines. This sentence I think makes my point about editorial perfectly “If the analysis of the satellite imagery is accurate, North Korea may be taking a small but significant step toward the disarmament that was agreed upon by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump during a landmark meeting in Singapore on June 12.” How can a step be both “small” and “significant”?

We got prisoners that we can reasonably expect we would’ve gotten anyway, got empty promises from a despotic dictator which are now proven to have been ignored, and then discarded the whole affair. In exchange, North Korea got a significant amount of legitimacy. Look up how badly Kim Jong-Un’s father and grandfather wanted a picture of them meeting with a US President.

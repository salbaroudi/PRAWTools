9a2dxt;Revolver123;1535183095.0;If Facebook is such a slam dunk, then why..?
9a2dxt;Revolver123;1535183095.0;"So basically everywhere you look you see “Buy Facebook.” “Facebook is the easiest money in the stock market right now.” “Facebook is poised for huge gains in the future.” Most people are saying that Facebook is criminally undervalued at a 21 Forward PE. Even Kevin O’Leary endorses buying Facebook. People rave about Facebooks great balance sheet with 41 billion cash and 0 debt. Why hasn’t the stock price gone up since its drop at earnings then? One would think that if a stock is such “easy money” then everybody buys, which pushes the stock price higher. We saw that with Apple. Something smells fishy about this one.. There is an old adage.. If you hear a stock tip from your cab driver then.... "

e4s91su;pk1234553;1535184601.0;""Even Kevin O'Leary likes the stock"I like him but he was giving interviews and was all over CNBC telling everybody that he will never own a stock that doesn't pay a dividend and 70% of the markets return is through dividends and as soon as he launched his growth ETF ($OGIG) he changed his mind and was all over growth."
e4s9jny;floatingideas;1535185125.0;"You also have to understand that Facebook owns a crap ton of companies, top ones are Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus VR. The fact that they have had this much bad PR and the stock is still staying a float is a bit amazing actually."
e4s83r8;smellsmira;1535183601.0;"Nothing special about it. All it will take is privacy legislation to pass and there goes 50% of their data selling profit. "
e4t17hq;lykosen11;1535228541.0;"Facebook stock is suppressed because the public image of the company is really bad right now. Even so, people use all its services like normal.Uncertain markets are non growing market, and if a stock trades sideways whole the company is growing as fast as Facebook, it's 100% just market worry and Facebook will be very very undervalued in the end, and shoot up.Facebook is 20% of my portfolio and 0 worries. It's such a money making machine it's absurd. "
e4tzbz4;Hassan_Gym;1535264675.0;"Because everyone is expecting Facebook to explode in the next decade. If there's anyone that can create a virtual world that people of all ages can experience, it's Facebook. They have the data and the ecosystem to do so."
e4s8sq9;ineednarcan;1535184335.0;"It's overvalued. "
e4u28de;iboiloil;1535267828.0;"Why anyone likes that guy I will never understand. "
e4sr6qo;kCinvest;1535207218.0;"So he is trying to convince people of becoming his customers? I wonder who else does that? Maybe everyone? (Except for those that doesnt understand capitalism). "
e4sdhh1;Tsegen;1535189292.0;"> All it will take is privacy legislation to pass andIs anyone betting on Congress standing up to corporate power at this point? "
e4sw5eb;Trilletto;1535217962.0;"and since they don‘t sell data 50% of 0 is 0"
e4s9ujc;tarantula13;1535185427.0;"Why?"
e4svpel;pk1234553;1535216911.0;"I get why he is doing it but when you spend years telling people that you would never own a stock that doesn't pay a dividend, that it doesn't make sense, etc and then you change your mind overnight you kind of lose your credibility"
e4sdp0k;smellsmira;1535189516.0;"Pretty sure legislation is already in the works. Could see it by 2020. Something similar to Europe's right to be anonymous. "
e4vcdy9;grounded_astronaut;1535331934.0;"Screw that, what really matters is "do these elderly or nearly elderly politicians understand what's going on with this technology.""
e4sa2kf;ineednarcan;1535185658.0;"It just is!"
e4teg6d;NonrestrictiveBroom;1535243734.0;"The whole dividend obsession was pretty stupid to begin with."
e4saz5t;tarantula13;1535186594.0;"Thanks for contributing lol"
e4sm5wj;Dallywack3r;1535199334.0;"Great financial analysis. Look forward to your next book “Apple is crap cuz I say so.”"
e4sahcx;floatingideas;1535186082.0;"I think if they didn't have instagram, I would agree and say its overvalued.. I think its right where it should be right now around 160-170 until they can figure out higher revenue growth with instagram or purchase another revenue generating company."
e4t59lz;pdiddy117;1535234123.0;"Wrong answer retard"
e4sbaar;floatingideas;1535186914.0;"I try"
e4scic6;Revolver123;1535188242.0;"What are you basing that off of? Their PE ratio is far below what other tech stocks with high growth are right now. "
e4sm336;Lush9031;1535199237.0;"PE in the low 20s, zero debt, high earnings and revenue growth (even with the cut in forecast), large user growth to still be realized in Asia, growth of instagram and other platforms. This company is set up well to be a steady growth company going forward.If you have any experience with their ad platform it is amazing how it works, my business uses it quite a bit and will continue to. Their lack of debt and high margins gives me confidence that going into the next recession they will be able to survive and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. Investing in companies that print money is usually a safe bet. Full disclosure I’ve bought 10k in shares during this recent downturn. More towards your question, I believe this downturn is being overplayed and the market will eventually correct its mistake as future earnings come out."

9aozqk;WaveML;1535405846.0;Where's the "moat" or value for companies like Uber/Lyft/DiDi/Grab? Aren't they essentially worthless? What am I missing here?
9aozqk;WaveML;1535405846.0;"**TLDR: Ridesharing companies' massive valuations are based off of a driverless taxi future. However, it seems that in this future almost all the profits will go to the companies that have solved the hard tasks of manufacturing the cars and designing the self driving AI software, not the relatively easy to replicate task of building the app that customers use to order the taxis. What am I missing here?**In light of the Uber IPO next year I've been thinking about the multi billion valuations for ridesharing companies like Uber/Lyft/DiDi/Grab.As far as I can see, their perceived value comes from driverless cars. The idea is that in the future many people won't even own a car, they will just call up a driverless taxi when they want to go somewhere (the combination of no drivers' salaries and the fact that cars being able to drive 24/7 will reduce the number of cars that need to be bought will make the taxi services cheaper than owning your own car). Ridesharing companies, as the tools with which customers call their robo-taxis, will hence get a big slice of this multi-trillion dollar market.However, I can't understand why these ridesharing companies get a place in this driverless future at all. As far as I can see, we can break down the driverless taxi service into three components:* **Manufacturing the actual physical cars.** This is a very difficult engineering challenge; it requires both great industry knowledge and a large number of factories. This "moat" makes it hard for someone to just come in and start their own car manufacturing company, which in turn ensures that the company can have a decent markup/profit on their cars.* **Designing the AI software that drives the cars.** Again, this is a very hard engineering challenge which ensures that there's a "moat" that stops competitors and hence safeguards profits.* **Building the app that people use to call up the taxi.** I'm not saying this task is entirely trivial, but (speaking as someone who works in tech/AI) it's not that hard for a reasonably large tech company to quickly make a reasonable looking app that lets users order a taxi, and it's definitely nowhere near as hard as the first two. As far as I can see, there's very little "moat" here, anyone can easily move into this area, which means that there's very little profit available in just running the app that people use to contact the cars.As far as I can see, if driverless cars become feasible/reliable, then it's very likely that the companies with the driverless AI software will just buy cars (or partner with car manufacturing companies) and launch their own taxi service because there's no way that they're going to let Uber/Lyft/DiDi/Grab act as a middleman and keep a big slice of the profits. I suppose that the existing ridesharing companies could stay in business by cutting prices until they're only marginally higher than the cost of cars+driverless software, but then they're not gonna make much profit and hence don't justify their current massive vaulations.I've seen a couple of counterarguments to this, but they don't make sense to me:* **The ridesharing companies can build/are building their own driverless car technology.** Firstly, driverless car technology is extremely difficult, and from what I've read, companies like Uber are well behind the industry leaders like Google's Waymo and GM Cruise. Furthermore, I don't see why starting work on driverless cars (or claiming you can make them in the future) justifies the huge valuations that ridesharing companies currently have; surely it makes more sense to give a large valuation to the startups that have made the most progress in driverless cars (the technology that's hard to replicate) rather than the startups which have so far only proved that they can build a taxi app (the technology that's very easy to replicate).* **The network effect/brand loyalty.** From what I can tell, this just doesn't really apply much to taxi services. All the available evidence has shown that consumers pick the cheapest service that  can keep waiting times below 3 minutes (i.e. there's no extra network effect once your company has a certain number of cars in a given city). If I recall correctly the driver's salary is about 85% the cost of a taxi ride; while ridesharing companies can cut this cost a bit, the reality is that a company with good driverless car tech could easily undercut ridesharing companies by a ridiculous margin while still remaining profitable. In terms of reaching the number of cars needed to keep waiting times below 3 minutes, a large company like Google can just buy the cars needed to achieve this in a given city, take over the market in that city, and then move onto the next one (this is a bit different to something like Facebook where there's a global network that is harder to disrupt unless you can convince a large number of people all over the world to move to your service at the same time).Of course, there's a reasonable chance that driverless cars will prove to be infeasible with current technology. But then the main "nobody will own their own car any more" value proposition for these companies is gone. And furthermore, due to the lack of proper network effects that I mentioned earlier, it's unlikely that these companies will be able to make much profit at all (since someone else will come in the moment that they try to jack up prices). Hence again I can't see why these companies have such high valuations.What am I missing here? Why are the valuations for these companies so high?"

e4wzv8s;nebulousmenace;1535407235.0;"I'm kind of with you that these companies have very little moat (and I wouldn't buy them.)  The only thing I can think of is just brand recognition. For all I know there are twenty sodas I'd like better than Coke but I'll never find them. "
e4x0tm1;Helikaon242;1535408188.0;"This is a really good post that brings up some good points. I managed to think up a couple reasons why Uber etc. does have a moat, just for arguments' sake.Firstly, I think a lot of their moat could be legalistic. Uber has faced a ton of resistance to operation by municipal governments trying to protect taxi companies. Of course, Uber has made a lot of progress towards opening up many cities to ride sharing apps in general, not Uber specifically, but it also seems likely that many municipalities are more likely to maintain a "whitelist" of apps, and it may be difficult to get a new app approved for use.Second, to your point about network effects, I agree that customer loyalty could evaporate very quickly if prices increase. However, until that happens, I think people will likely prefer to use just a single app for finding a taxi, and not having to juggle 5 or 6 different tools that each have a smaller driver base, and it will be costly for a new company to invest in to getting the critical mass of users to maintain their network. In this sense, Uber does have an early mover advantage.Finally, I think the valuation mainly comes from the large userbase and potential for expanding sources of revenue through opening up more cities and adding more users, or by adding alternative products like Uber Eats. It's hard to analyze the quality of their revenue, though, since the company is private. Driverless car tech is doubtlessly a part of that valuation, though I'm not sure how much. Even if the AI is potentially a long way off, the upside potential is quite massive so I can understand it may have a significant impact on market cap."
e4xgten;miscsubs;1535422423.0;"I guess we'll see more when (if) Uber goes public but my guess would be their valuation is NOT based on that driverless future you describe.Uber owning a fleet of cars is exactly what would (should) scare a good investor, whether it comes with a human driver or not. That's a lot of assets that would sit idly on a down market and would need constant maintenance even in good times.Their current model is what makes them attractive (assuming it's sustainable) : Very few physical assets, no inventory needed, low employee count (again - the driver doesn't count). The model is more or less recession-proof. In bad times, revenue dips but not the margins. If there were no regulations, extending the app and the network effect to new cities should really cost very little while still bringing in profits. Plus pricing power as the network expands, yada yada.But of course, all of the above comes with a lot of assumptions. These companies resemble pure SW companies as they are currently structured. Very high margins, low fixed costs, at least in theory.I assume Uber's CEO is not selling "We'll own a million driverless cars" to his investors. He's probably saying people will own driverless cars and Uber will install their own ride-finding AI or something on those cars to connect riders with rides using the same model. Or something like that..."
e4x0q8v;NoHoldVictory;1535408096.0;">The idea is that in the future many people won't even own a car, they  will just call up a driverless taxi when they want to go somewhere (the  combination of no drivers' salaries and the fact that cars being able to  drive 24/7 will reduce the number of cars that need to be bought will  make the taxi services cheaper than owning your own car).This could also be wrong. With a driverless car, your car could become more like a driving living room or office. Its possible that people spend even more time inside their cars. This could lead people to further individualize the interior to their liking. And this would make the case for people still buying their own cars instead of using robo taxis. Whether its for better functionality (office equipment or what ever) or a certain look ("living room" interior).​"
e4xi75o;ak1368a;1535423614.0;"Profitless companies have not moat, just the same as a depression in the ground can't have a moat. there is no protecting profitability if there is no profitability."
e4x6jhv;cobarx;1535413502.0;"The network effect is more pronounced than you realize. Starting up in an area requires a critical mass of drivers to ensure a ride will quickly be available to pick up a passenger. When Uber & other services go into an area, they subsidize a large initial pool of drivers by providing free or discounted rides until they have a solid rider pool. The vast majority of Uber's investment money has gone to breaking into & stabilizing these markets.​Over time, Uber & Lyft are improving the mapping & logistics components that allow them to squeeze out small efficiency improvements. Any new competitor in a market where ride share is already setup is going to have to do the same promo spends to build driver & rider numbers while going into a market where people already have an app installed and are behind on tech & efficiency. It's hard for me to imagine many companies wanting to invest tends of billions of dollars to attempt to break into a market where Uber has a first mover advantage and is making little to no money.&#x200B;This will only get more pronounced as the companies move into other services like scooters, bikes, and package deliveries. The existing app installs give them a free advertising channel. Drivers can be incentivized to support the other services - ending your night & only a few blocks away from some scooters? Grab them & bring them home to charge them, rather than having to have to have a separate set of people travel further to handle that.&#x200B;edit: Add note about other services offered thru the apps"
e4x0ivs;mdatwood;1535407892.0;"The moat is brand recognition and ubiquity which is important when you need network effects, and must get people to install an app. People also do not want to check 3,4,10 apps for the best price/time. They at most might check 2 or 3.> the reality is that a company with good driverless car tech could easily undercut ridesharing companies by a ridiculous margin while still remaining profitableWe are a long ways from this really happening. With that said, Uber is definitely investing in driverless technology."
e4x2yf4;rebelde_sin_causa;1535410230.0;"There are a lot of great points in your post and in this thread.What I will add is that it's no coincidence that the ridesharing industry was built in a time of cheap oil/gas prices. More expensive oil/gas, which sooner or later follows cheap oil/gas like night follows day, will change the picture completely. When it's more expensive, the drivers will have to be paid more (or they won't drive), customers will have to be charged more, and nobody really knows yet how this will affect the business. This goes for some other folks too, i.e. AMZN.And speaking of AMZN, I don't think it's a monumental task for someone who already has great market penetration on everybody's mobile device, i.e. them or Apple, Google et al, to make a ridesharing app that eats Uber's lunch. The reason they haven't already done it, IMO, is that right now it's not a good business."
e4x5twe;antiquatipated;1535412860.0;"I see what you mean.Maybe the value is with the brand value / Mindshare. The name.There are a few brand names who have become synonymous with the product/technology they produce (Uber is literally one of them; “I’m just going to get an Uber..”).There is value in that. I would say that the best chance for these brands to survive would be to decouple their brand name from the risks of actual (infant) technology.It means they can use the best tech until it’s not longer the best, or it kills people, and then switch to the new-best.- If an Uber crashes, the responsibility can be with the OEM, and the brand can switch to the new most-trusted OEM; PR dream.It’s also worth noting that it’s easier to protect a brand when consumer-sentiment is the only product; and not reliant on the performance of physical measurements of an actual product, especially in an emerging technology.A consumer-sentiment business is a lot more volatile, but the volatility is actually mitigated by the consumer-loyalty that a brand like Uber already has!That is why they are happy to make a loss; they are growing a decoupled brand; a synonymous-name rather than a physical product.That is their true product; not the actual cars ..or the real people currently driving them..Businesses have learned what politics is to statehood, and are applying it to the consumer market."

They'll need enough cars to meet peak demand. Most people need a ride in the morning and then after work. If you meet peak demand, there's going to be an awful lot of empty cars the rest of the day. Also, removing the driver doesn't save Uber that much money. If you look at some driver's budgets, once they deduct gas, insurance, depreciation, etc, their net earnings is small and sometimes zero. If Uber owns the cars, they are going to need to pay those costs themselves. In addition, they are going to need to pay for parking all their cars during non peak hours."
e4xj22n;illini81;1535424463.0;"Decent analysis, however you've got a huge gap in your timelines and based on the unbelievable global scale of these companies there is plenty of money to justify the valuations. Long-term, it makes more sense to partner with ride-sharing networks instead of trying to build your own. I'm guessing Cruise or Waymo will piggyback on the existing network for scale and reduced regulatory friction. In terms of the costs to acquire customers, on top of the billions sunk into the R&D of the underlying technology, why wouldn't these companies plug and play into an existing network and forgo the years of building a brand and customer base, when they can start getting an ROI from day 1 on an existing network?I think you've 100% undervalued the tech and research these companies have put into the product they have built. Uber alone has thousands of employees, many of them some of the best engineers in the world, sharpening their operations. It's not even close to as simple as you're making it out. For someone like Waymo or Cruise to come in, it would take years to duplicate, on top of the years of regulatory battles to get autonomous on the road, and the years of manufacturing to build out the fleet and the associated maintenance operations to keep the vehicles up and running 24/7. This is at least 10, probably 20 years out. For either of these companies to reach the same scale as Uber - providing similar ETAs and availability, they would need hundred of thousands, possibly millions of cars."

As the 20 years gets closer, minus unexpected growth or expansion into another business model with expected positive growth (e.g. driverless taxis), the value of the company will decrease over time."
e4xy3sp;charg3;1535437546.0;"I think to understand these companies valuations, you need to understand what they actually do.  They are not just “ride sharing” they are actually automated logistics.  When you think about it in that way, you understand why they are valuable regardless of a driverless future.  These companies come up with algorithms to efficiently get things or people from point A to point B, and Uber is REALLY good at this.  The moat around their business depends on their proprietary code.  Their value can scale as they venture into other areas of logistics.  As they expand into other areas, their costs go up linearly while their revenue will scale exponentially. This is obviously not guaranteed: there will be competition, but the potential is huge.  "

e4y9i02;Immorain;1535449285.0;"The value of big data companies(like uber) are that they store marketing information they may influence your expenditure in the future. For example, in the case of uber, lets just say the app recognises that you go to macdonalds often. Maybe uber will then pump ubereats macdonald advertisements.(simplifiying so as to not imply uber sells marketing information). While it is true that it is not difficult to generate an app, it is extreamly difficult to generate a large enough database. You may be thinking " ah when i create an app lets just give free ride to let it gain traction" . It would be investment worthy if you were the pioneer. However as the market matures, new startup will find it difficult to enter the market. A strong example would be ryde, a new ride hailing company that is competing against grab( took over uber in southeast asia) in singapore. Although they offer attractive prices to both riders and driver, the app just could not gain traction as grab took up over 80% of the market share.Both riders and drivers are uncertain about the longevity of the app and thus prefer to use a "tested and trusted" brand. Hence that is the investment value of uber. Self driving cars may be the outline of plan however uber is only valuable as a big data company ,not in technology."

As for more mature competitors like Lyft, they will always mount competition. Always! Uber was swallowed by Didi in China because of regional competition (or, read: discrimination and protection). There are Indian and Singaporean spinoffs. Competition. Always.   As far as driverless cars, who knows when the technology will \*actually\* be integrated to society. Until then, Uber's figures are good, are impressive, people use Uber. Companies can always grow and adapt.  Regarding valuation, that's an interpretation. Is a company valuable because it manufactures 80% of Louis Vuitton leather bags? Yes. Owns lots of airplanes? Well, yeah. But can a company be valuable just because it has a huge userbase, forward-thinking leadership that has gained investor confidence, and plans to move forward with the times or explore other spaces? Sure. (Not saying this is the case with Uber; but hey, UberEats. I don't use it.)   The point is that valuation is more than 'owning' something. Business models can be more complex, innovative, and attractive than that.  "

Very little other than brand loyalty and a solid easy to use product.  Tech has changed the world from a product based economy to an eyeball based one.  He who has the eyeballs can afford the innovation to move the market forward.  For example, why can’t uber move into long haul travel like airlines?  Why couldn’t they extend their reach into senior citizen communities who have a huge need but little technology penetration?  While everyone else is trying to catch up, Uber can keep moving ahead.  As it keeps moving ahead, it will be harder and harder for competitors to steal users because people will have gotten used to using Uber.So, I think their moat is deeper than you’re giving them credit for.

Of course Uber would be well poised to take advantage of partnerships with whoever the big players are, but all it would take it Tesla snubbing Uber in favour of their own app, and bam, Uber is cooked. It's an incredibly high risk investment and I have steered clear. Companies like Tesla are really well positioned to leverage their proprietary technology, infrastructure, and manufacturing when self driving becomes a reality. They can control the entire supply chain. In such a future, cars are ordered, not owned. People might subscribe to Tesla and receive tiered access to certain transport and features. No messing around with parking spaces, taxes, theft, collision, insurance, maintenance, devaluation, service, and all the other things that go with car ownership. This model results in huge efficiencies for society. Much less traffic and much less waste, and, of course, much lower transport costs for everyone. On the other side, it also means fewer cars sold. Whoever makes it past the finish line first is going to cripple traditional auto manufacturing, in addition to the millions of US jobs directly displaced by driverless vehicles, and the tens of millions indirectly affected: insurance companies, panel beaters, tire companies, mechanics, oil companies/gas stations, etc."

I assumed the end goal would be for the company that comes up with the best AI for driverless to license it to car manufacturers. The only reason it's not being done that way during development is because the companies working on the software would want to have full control over every aspect of their vehicles and prevent corporate espionage. &#x200B;So yeah, the actual driverless AI/software tech is the moat. The bet is that these companies that are gathering hundreds of terabytes of data about traffic patterns, driving styles, road conditions, vehicle types and accident occurrences will make the more efficient and profitable software.

And not every driver is making $0.  If uber has a big enough fleet, that concern is mitigated.  And they can likely also streamline the maintenance side of things and save money there.

At it's most extreme, you have regulatory capture (regulators doing what the corporation wants, rather than advancing our interests).

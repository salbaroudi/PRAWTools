9ag8k4;coolantratio;1535325257.0;"Hey folks, I just finished Boglehead's Guide to Investing and looking for the next suggested read. My lists consists of:* Boglehead's Guide to Retirement* The Little Book on Common Sense Investing* Boglehead's Three-fund Portfolio* Coffeehouse InvestorAnything else you all would recommend?My current goals are to properly invest in my retirement and understand investing in general. I am very new to this and I liked the way Boglehead's Guide to Investing broke everything down for me. "

e4v8dqh;Skiinz19;1535327990.0;"What I learned losing a million dollarsThe first half is well written and engaging story of how he lost the money. The next half is what he learned and what to avoid. It's all about an investor's mindset and discipline. A must read.Pick it up, read the second half, and if you want another quick fun read, do the first half."
e4vf26b;TomCollator;1535334548.0;"This reading assignment  does not require you to get out of your seat.Go the the Bogleheads forum and see if you like the discussions there.[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php)​The Bogleheads forum are of bunch of Bogle fans, all though they are not knee jerk Bogle fans and have some differences in opinion.  You may end up talking to some of the authors of the Boglehead books you have read.​The Bogleheads have a list of books they recommend, (although they can't all agree on which is best.​[https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Books:\_recommendations\_and\_reviews](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Books:_recommendations_and_reviews)"
e4voi1m;m1garand30064;1535343640.0;"Any of those on your list are fine.  I also really like William Bernstein's books.Don't bother with the intelligent investor. Outside of chapters 8 and 20 it is worthless. It gets circle jerk recommended because Warren Buffett said it helped him out in the 1940's. It is not relevant today."

e4vcdxc;denny2000;1535331933.0;"The Boglehead’s guide to investments is an awesome book. It really explains a lot in the personal finance domain. So is the Bogleheads guide to retirement different than the investment book? I figure they would be very similar. Is it worth it to read both? "
e4vhd1r;Sheck27;1535336808.0;"I thought the coffeehouse investor was a waste of time. I really enjoyed A Random Walk Down Wall Street and The Intelligent Investor. Either one of those would be worthwhile! "
e4vvuyy;cognitiveflow;1535350947.0;"It really depends on if you want to be an active or passive investor. Your reading list is like an echo chamber of passive investing - I'm not knocking indexing btw, it's the best strategy for most - however, it's only a small part of the investing landscape.   Even if you are content with indexing returns, as part of a more comprehensive understanding of securities, you may be interesting to learning basic accounting, economics, behavioral finance/psychology, security analysis, valuation, and studying how the best investors operate.  &#x200B;    &#x200B;"

e4wudc7;firstreminder;1535400856.0;"If you just skip all of the tables and skim the statistical analysis it's worth reading the whole thing. There's no point in reading in depth about the mustang motor company for the 12th time though. It's a pretty cool historical record though and if you're reading the last version of it, it's cool to see what he was recommending when savings accounts earned more than bonds."

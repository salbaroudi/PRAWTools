9abs9q;akarivelil;1535274165.0;"This is based on my post here https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9a6gz4/how_to_get_out_of_the_loop_and_be_successfulI want to give an example of what I mean; Hydrogen fuel cars won't be mass produced until there is a large network of fuel delivery. And the network won't be a reality until mass adoption of Hydrogen fuel cars. This is what I was referring to. I want to know from a business stand point of view to how does this cycle gets broken."

e4uno5v;NoReallyFuckReddit;1535293396.0;">  I want to know from a business stand point of view to how does this cycle gets broken.The cycle gets broken when oil companies get their business model threatened.The production/distribution/consumption model for hydrogen isn't that dissimilar to oil.  Hell, even the engines that use it are basically the same (needlessly complex).The second way the cycle gets broken is when everyone realizes there's not enough raw materials to ever make full transportation electrification ever happen (there's not; it's just one huge pipe dream not being mediated by any sort of reality at this point in time).  This assumes two things:  1 - oil production is not able to keep up with demand (which it won't if all of China decides it wants to be American middle class) and 2 - the world starts giving a fuck about climate change."

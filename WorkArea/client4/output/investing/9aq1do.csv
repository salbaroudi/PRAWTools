9aq1do;yik77;1535413503.0;"My HSA is changing things a bit, for no obvious reason, and they will replace  VISGX with VSGAX. I am unable to find out, what is the difference and which one is better. Any ideas?     "

e4x79tv;BaskinRobinson;1535414148.0;"VISGX and VSGAX are different classes of the same fund:VISGX = Investor SharesVSGAX = Admiral Shares (lower expenses, $10k minimum investment required)What happened here is that your VISGX investment reached $10k and you were automatically upgraded to Admiral shares. Congrats!"

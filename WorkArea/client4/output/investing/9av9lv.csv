9av9lv;tme85;1535453280.0;"South Africa is on the verge of “re-distributing” land without just compensation to existing owners.I believe this is a disaster political move for the country and is virtually guaranteed to result in a decrease of GDP and overall productivity/prosperity for the country.What are some examples of market positions that would allow me to benefit from this decline of prosperity in  South Africa?"

e4yzuer;Thevidon;1535489976.0;"Yeah South Africa is doing some crazy racist shit to their white population. Here is all you need to know: A report by the South African Government's Financial and Fiscal Commission shows that land reform as a mechanism for agricultural development and job creation has failed. A survey by the commission in Limpopo province, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape found that most land reform farms show little or no agricultural activity; the land reform beneficiaries earn little to no income, and the majority of these beneficiaries seek work on surrounding commercial farms instead of actively farming their own land. Where farming is taking place on land reform farms, these farms operate below their full agricultural potential and are mainly used for subsistence agriculture. On average, crop production had decreased by 79% since conversion to land reform. In the three provinces surveyed, job losses averaged 84%, with KwaZulu-Natal suffering a 94% job haemorrhage."

e4yez23;WikiTextBot;1535455128.0;"**Land reform in South Africa**The Native Lands Act of 1913 "prohibited the establishment of new farming operations, sharecropping or cash rentals by blacks outside of the reserves" where they were forced to live. "Land restitution" was one of the promises made by the African National Congress when it came to power in South Africa in 1994.These property rights are extremely important as they empower farmer workers (who now have the opportunity to become farmers) and reduce inequality.  Their transaction costs are less than larger plots with hired labor.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

e4x08r4;civic19s;1535407609.0;"The guy should be in a think tank dreaming shit up.  Not running a fucking company.  "
e4wzh1d;PutSimpIy;1535406835.0;"He lost me with the whole website to rate journalists.  That's some fascist BS that I want no part of.  After that, he just kept showing oddness.    Glad I made some cash and got out before his madness started to show.  "
e4x23ev;OfficialHavik;1535409428.0;"Is the SEC still going to go get him after this whole "taking Tesla private" fiasco??"
e4x7dth;px403;1535414246.0;"Thinktanks don't actually get to build the future.  Imagine if the Xerox PARC crew actually had the resources to bring their stuff to market.  We would probably be a decade ahead of where we are now.  We need crazy people at all levels of the R&D process, including crazy people like me who keep giving Elon money, and I'll keep doing it too."
e4x0cw9;PutSimpIy;1535407724.0;"He needs a filter between himself and any social media.  In the least. I'm glad he revealed himself though, as I wouldn't want to support a person with his beliefs.  "
e4wzlbi;VisheshRai;1535406954.0;"He lost me after he bailed out his cousin's company (solar city) with Tesla cash. Also that time he called that diver a pedo. "
e4x762h;px403;1535414057.0;"What's wrong with that?  He wasn't talking about some central agency labeling some outlets as subversive or something, he was talking about a crowdsourced database that helps people to quickly understand potential bias in the news that they're reading.  Understanding bias is critically important, and tools to help people with it are very much lacking or nonexistent."
e4x10fr;sodenj5;1535408374.0;"Pravda. This was the first sign of the cracks beginning to show for me. "
e4x9q8r;civic19s;1535416322.0;"Let him stay in R&D by all means.  His ass clearly has no business being CEO.  "

e4x0960;PutSimpIy;1535407621.0;"Yep.  The pedo thing was just more fuel for the fire.  A hugely disappointing character reveal.  The ambien defense didn't help things for me either.  "
e4xauan;Yurion13;1535417286.0;"he bailed out his cousin and himself. He was also a big share holder in Solar City. "
e4wzpwx;50calPeephole;1535407087.0;"Don't forget when he went to Twitter joking about bankrupcy"
e4x2d2k;SourceHouston;1535409680.0;"Te whole transaction is complex and smells like conflict of interest "
e4x7grs;PutSimpIy;1535414319.0;"You seem to be a regular apologist for corruption.  What's your goal here?  Spreading a little fascism for fun, or are you on the russian payroll?    "
e4x7app;PutSimpIy;1535414170.0;"Wow.  Okay.    When the inspiration comes from news you don't like about yourself that is likely rooted in truth, there is a HUGE problem.    "
e4x241o;PutSimpIy;1535409445.0;"That's what my comment said.  "

e4xbgxv;VisheshRai;1535417825.0;"True. His middle name is conflict of interest"
e4x8u2k;px403;1535415543.0;"It seems to me like you're awfully concerned about people looking into bias and trying to unmask fake news sources.  That seems a hell of a lot more "russian troll farmy" than what I was saying.Also I think it's completely fucked that 90+% of the impact Russian troll farms are having are communities tearing themselves apart, accusing each other of shilling etc.  This is why we need more community curated sites like snopes etc.  The flood of misinformation is overwhelming."
e4x2c40;sodenj5;1535409655.0;"I’m agreeing with you. "
DELETED;NoAuthor;-1;DELETED;
e4x9570;PutSimpIy;1535415811.0;"Yeah, what you and Elon are talking about aren't snopes.  He wants a site that essentially bashes journalists not favorable to him.  "
e4xpvzo;px403;1535430197.0;"You're making things up that sound good in your head and then vomiting them into public forums as if they were fact.  Stop it, it's exactly that sort of attitude that's destroying the internet as a communications platform.  We need a way to squelch the bullshit edgy agenda people like you are trying to preach, and promote rational dialogue and well sourced factual information."
e4xs4bu;PutSimpIy;1535432029.0;"Elon?"

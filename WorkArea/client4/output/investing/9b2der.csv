9b2der;for-every-answer;1535516151.0;"I have been thinking about divesting from the stock market and moving those funds to investments/businesses that are in my community. Has anyone done something like this before? Does anyone have any ideas?"

e4zvpv4;bms0430;1535518000.0;"If you don't have a specific idea in mind, keep it in stocks.  If you do have an idea in mind, definitely don't put 100% into it."
e501mqk;rageingnonsense;1535523196.0;"I suppose you could sign up for something like lendingclub.com, but providing small loans and/or cash advances to local businesses is high risk. A lot of time a failing business will be over extended with multiple loans, and these peer to peer lending sites don't provide enough data to you to be able to make a determination on whether its a safe enough investment for you. For lendingclub, I ended up not going for it, because all they provide are letter/color grades; with no way for me to know how they grade the loans. I am not loaning money to small businesses without being able to know how they are being graded. At the end of the day, if they are borrowing cash, they are potentially in a bad way (or maybe they just need some cash to fix a broken oven, who knows). If this is still something you really want to get involved in, you'll want to research MCAs (merchant cash advances). They are like loans, but the end balance is pre-determined, and the payment is acquired on fixed basis. They are popular among small businesses who either could not get a bank loan (riskyyyy), or prefer the terms of an MCA. Some MCA companies will let you participate in these MCAs as an investor."
e4zuqnw;LCJonSnow;1535517165.0;"Why?&#x200B;That's not a dick question.  The stock market is largely passive, generally liquid, and for the most part has reliable/standardized accounting. Your local small business are likely going to require an active amount of your time, aren't nearly as liquid, and as I'm learning working for a local "small" business, the accounting is often an absolute shit show.  &#x200B;If you're fine handing the latter, go for it.  There's probably greater upside potential, but it comes with a lot more risk.  I personally don't want any part of investing in a small business.  Maybe one day I'll get the entrepreneurial itch, but I don't have it now. "

e4zxva4;for-every-answer;1535519846.0;"First, thanks for taking the time to reply.Whyâ€¦good question. A couple of reasons, first, I've become disillusioned with the idea that my capital is being used efficiently in the stock market rather than to justify executive pay. Second, I'd rather see (with my own eyes) my money being put to use in my community.I own two businesses, one a SASS company and the other a consulting company. But, those don't need investment.Just trying to see if anyone has moved there money from the market to their local community and maybe a way to diversify it at a local level."

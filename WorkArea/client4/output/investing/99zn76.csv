99zn76;danellender;1535162297.0;Irrational Exuberance? Or just Exuberance?
99zn76;danellender;1535162297.0;"That phrase came up in a conversation the other day. The market talk these days seems very bubbly. On the other hand, other than it going up and up, there doesn't seem to be anything adding gravity to pull it down. I think upcoming interest rate rises are already priced in. The only sign I see of any move is a slight increase in the long bond ETF, BLV. So what do you think, exuberance, or irrational exuberance? Or something else?"

e4s38qc;CanYouPleaseChill;1535178590.0;"There is a lot of irrational exuberance out there today, with people continuing to extrapolate recent growth trends to the distant future. The reality is, many companies are priced at absurd levels, and no one seems to care. It's reminiscent of both the Nifty Fifty stocks and the tech bubble of the 90s. You have companies like Brown Forman and Tiffany & Co. trading at P/Es in the upper 30s. You have AMZN and NFLX at 150 and 163. And there's a multitude of tech stocks whose cash flows are growing increasingly negative year after year. Loss-making companies have absolutely flooded the IPO market. That will all come to a halt as soon as capital becomes tighter to come by and these companies start to file for bankruptcies, one after another. "

e4rnbut;JustAsIgnorantAsYou;1535164204.0;"It's too hard to say.I mean, the 10yr is still below 3%, which is not much of a hurdle. At the same time, many of the largest companies (Google, FB, Apple, Microsoft but also a few dozen smaller ones in the S&P500) probably deserve very high multiples, given that they have incredible returns on capital and seemingly strong competitive advantages. This is a huge difference from most companies back in the day, and they really should be compared to unique companies like Philip Morris and Coca-Cola, which were permanently undervalued for almost all of the 20th century. Then we have a bunch of companies which are incredibly hard to value. I mean, what's the earning power of Amazon or Netflix in ten years? I'm not even sure what their earning power is today. But they are huge, and they probably deserve to be, and they as well have smaller brothers and sisters all over the S&P500 which are equally hard to value while also being legitimate successful businesses. So we have all these factors which kinda justify an "expensive" market but don't give us a very clear direction as to *how* expensive. That said, I think there are very clear pockets of insanity in terms of valuations. But any "justified" bull market generally creates a few of those as well."
e4rrj67;danellender;1535167842.0;"Sorry about using the adjective 'bubbly'. I didn't mean it in the usual sense of stock market bubbles, rather in the excitement about it's new highs. Sort of like champagne. Celebratory. Poor choice of words considering. "
e4tnqdo;billbixbyakahulk;1535252863.0;"Corporate debt is possibly in danger territory.  Big corps are hoarding cash and will weather the storm best.Household debt is at all time highs but unemployment numbers are very solid.  My biggest concern is sometime in the next couple years, inflation starts to really heat up and the Fed will, as usual, act too slowly, allowing bubbles to form.  Once that turns, and combined with high corporate/household debt loads, it may not take much shifting of employment numbers to see significant default rates.  The more extended we are, the faster the contraction.  Most people will get a tax cut next year, so I'm not worried about 2019 at the moment."
e4v1i5r;Maxxenter;1535320362.0;"Don't forget Greenspan's irrational exuberance statement was at the end of 1996. The real bull run hadn't even started yet."Bubbles" are just a useless concept IMO. Things are either crashing or look bubbly. There is never a time that looks like "worry free ATM money printing with no risk". "
e4rmns7;lol_wut94;1535163633.0;"nobody ever said Mr. Market was a rational dude"
e4s30se;WizOnTheFence;1535178367.0;"Companies driving the crazy all time highs in the market are mostly companies that didn’t exist in 2008 or were new to being listed on an exchange.  These “tech” companies also sell software and not hardware so they can print money. Trying to compare this market to that of 1998 and 2008 is laughable because circumstances were different and the innovative companies of those times are very different from the innovators today. It may seem “bubbly” because of the crazy returns we are seeing, but it makes perfect sense if you look at the power of the software as a service companies and the FANGS. "

9a403x;urriola35;1535198087.0;"With the September 6th deadline approaching for the $200 Billion in tariffs what companies will face the most headwinds. My current hypothesis is John Deere, Boeing, and Caterpillar. I‚Äôm looking to buy Late September Put options on a company facing the biggest trade war headwinds."

e4slnso;ccc45p;1535198689.0;"Trump's twitter seems to be trending softer on the trade war rhetoric. Personally as an indexer I'm holding what I have, putting new money in my cash position, and using alcohol liberally throughout the process."
e4sq49t;Stosstruppe;1535205296.0;"Alibaba and Baidu (not a fan of Tencent). Keep an eye on those, look to invest during it's downs, invest even more if more tariffs are announced. Only Chinese companies I think are worth investing in."
e4smz44;SDSunDiego;1535200444.0;"Think bigger picture; the market was already pricing in the more aggressive tariffs on election day. The market wasn't necessarily pricing the actually function of tariffs but it was absolutely pricing some sort of favorable business action.Even with the declaration of tariffs, market is at historic all time highs, meaning this was expected to some degree. "
e4sor6e;AlNOKEA;1535203088.0;"I put down half positions on BABA and IQ just recently. If the tariffs go through and they drop harder I might buy the other half "
e4tjkh0;Surveyer13579;1535248756.0;"Head and tailwinds from the tariffs are priced in. 1,000 financial analysts wrote papers months ago answering your exact question 6 months ago for their boss - but they had a lot more time and data to consider. Tariffs are dominating the news and the news influences stock prices. Think about the stocks+(growing) sectors that won't be impacted by the tariffs and as a result have lost recent media coverage. I mean Disney's stock price is unchanged and their P/E isn't anything to brag about, even though they print $10 billion income every year and now own fox, so have become a quasi monopoly. "
e4tz5zp;Helikaon242;1535264501.0;"A bit late to the thread, but nobody else has made my point yet.Look at companies from *other* nations that actually benefit from a US-China trade conflict.A couple examples: US auto-producers are facing tariffs in China, which includes American companies (Ford, GM, etc.) but also producers that make their cars in the US (Some German companies). By comparison, a company like Toyota, who's Chinese-market cars are produced in China or Japan, would be unaffected by the tariffs and may gain market share.Similarly, China imported the largest proportion of soybeans from US farmers, but have started substituting those imports with Brazilian farmers who's prices haven't been impacted by the tariffs.There are probably a handful of international opportunities like this depending on what ETFs you may have access to."

e4u0dvq;okaywhattho;1535265796.0;"I'm also interested to hear this answer. The other day a native Chinese user mentioned how he wouldn't touch any Chinese stocks with a 10 foot pole but mentioned that, if he were to jump at any, Tencent would be the one. He attributed it to their absolute dominance of China in every sphere. [Here'](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/99s300/which_falling_knives_are_you_trying_to_catch/e4qhooi/) the comment: "I live in China and I wouldn't be worried about Ten Cent. I don't have a position as I'm not comfortable owning Chinese stocks, but its products dominate everyday life here. It's difficult to see how anyone can compete with them too, as most of their products have self-reinforcing user-growth. By that I mean, in order to compete with Ten Cent, you need a substantial user base already in place, but only Ten Cent has a substantial user base to begin with. The only companies in a position to compete with Ten Cent are western ones, but they're effectively barred from Chinese markets.""

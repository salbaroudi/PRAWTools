9b02t9;certifeyedgenius;1535500376.0;Salesforce Earnings Release Tomorrow. Why I'm buying.
9b02t9;certifeyedgenius;1535500376.0;"Salesforce seems to be firing on all cylinders lately. With their new tower in San Francisco at the new Transbay Terminal, the feeling in the air here is very strong. Last May, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, an integration software that brings apps on premises and cloud together. In my line of work, Mulesoft is a powerful platform that is used widely in major organizations and I believe this position will be key to their revenue growth. On one hand, Salesforce sold a debt bond of 2.5B to secure the deal, affecting their balance sheet, but the revenue opportunity will show in P&Ls to come. The bay area tech rumor mill is that Dropbox is next.  Earlier this year, SF invested $100M in the company's IPO, and Dropbox has been integrating greatly with them. Though Dropbox has a much higher market cap than when Mulesoft was acquired, SF continues to buy shares in company. In the past year, the share price has surged 61% and I expect the trend to continue. Rolling the dice here guys. What do you think?"

e4zn3fo;oahayder;1535510743.0;"Great company with a lot of growth room left. However trading at a PE ratio of ~160 seems to be a bit expensive. With tech giants like AAPL, FB and GOOG under 40 they seem like more value plays."

e5084en;shawnee_;1535529296.0;"> In the past year, the share price has surged 61% and I expect the trend to continue. That is a very stupid bet to make, considering market cap is already at 112.28 Billion.  In what universe does it make sense for that to get even bigger?  Not in any universe, ever.  Neither is 61 percent less than that.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a market cap of even $1B?  This company is overflowing with snake oil salesmen, masters of fraud, and has almost 10 years of ongoing accounting fraud.  Go ahead and bet on that. The entire worldwide market for something like headphones is "only" going reach [about 15.8 Billion by the year 2025](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-earphones-headphones-market).  The entire worldwide market for cloud storage was only [31B in 2017](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cloud-storage-market-size-is-expected-to-grow-from-usd-3070-billion-in-2017-to-usd-8891-billion-by-2022-at-a-compound-annual-growth-rate-cagr-of-237-300597852.html), including all of Amazon and Google's. Their EPS are (and will be reported as) a lie.  The REAL P/E is probably going to actually be closer to 7,650, not 166 (yes, even the 166 number is based off of fluffed up accounting fraud).  Pay attention to the GAAP numbers and GAAP EPS which are probably going to be pennies or negative.  It makes no sense for why this has surged recently, other than incomprehensible and despicable fraud by brokers like [Merrill Lynch](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/38176/Merrill-Lynch-Settles-SEC-Charges-of-Undisclosed-Conflict-in-Advisory-Decision) who handled the $3B loan CRM took out to by Mulesoft.  There is no logic and everybody who loses on this deserves to lose their money.    "

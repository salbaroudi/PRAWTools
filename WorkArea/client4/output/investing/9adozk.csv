9adozk;mattparlane;1535294525.0;Rebalancing any different when regularly adding income?
9adozk;mattparlane;1535294525.0;"I've been reading about periodic rebalancing, and it seems to be a reasonable strategy for the average Joe (which is me).My current allocation is roughly 5% cash, 20% bonds, 5% property, and 70% stocks, split among three markets.My only thought is that most of the articles/videos I've seen seem to be considering portfolios which are not being added to regularly -- they start with say $100k, split 50/50 or 60/40 or whatever, and then quarterly/annually/whatever rebalance, generally selling stocks and buying bonds.My intention is that I will be adding money regularly, and pulling money out very rarely (touch wood). It seems to me that I can achieve the same result by simply buying whatever is below my desired allocation in any given month. I should only need to sell out of one class when another class falls more in a year than I am able to make up with my regular income.Question is -- will that indeed achieve the same result? Or is there some difference that I'm missing?Thanks!"

e4utt0z;SirGlass;1535306698.0;"Yes will achieve the same result."
e4w0utq;big_deal;1535356418.0;"Maintaining your target allocation through contributions is probably the better method. It would certainly avoid tax implications and costs associated with extra trades (commissions, slippage, etc). As you add money and your portfolio grows, eventually it's not possible to rebalance with contribution and you have to sell assets and buy others. "
e4woexs;G_Morgan;1535389811.0;"This is what I do. I check twice a year and if my biggest deficit is smaller than a years contributions I just leave it. If it gets above a years contribution I'll do a manual rebalance."

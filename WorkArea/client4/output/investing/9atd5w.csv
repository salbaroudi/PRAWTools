9atd5w;Kingpawn87;1535437141.0;Insider trading?
9atd5w;Kingpawn87;1535437141.0;"So I was talking with a person ( turns out a CEO)  and learned something private about his business. Or at least information that I did not find with google. With this information the company looks way undervalued. Would this be considered insider trading?Edit: I don’t have a lot to trade with. It would be 3k. Also I’m keeping this vague on purpose and I won’t dare anything more about it.Edit2: thank you for your comments. After doing some research. I have concluded that it is clearly not insider trading.Source https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/05/03/how-united-states-v-newman-changes-the-law/I apologize as I should have done research first."

e4xycsh;benny_cpacma;1535437795.0;"I wouldn’t act on that information after making this post on Reddit "
e4xxypa;moomoodog_NA;1535437407.0;"the illegal practice of trading on the stock exchange to one's own advantage through having access to confidential information.That is the definition of insider trading :) "
e4y0g4f;Donnie-Jon-Hates-You;1535439905.0;"when the SEC investigators come knocking just remember the phrase, "I have no recollection of what was communicated between us on that day."...but realistically, you should just ask them to speak with you through your attorney."
e4y0w5p;SeinfeldMorty;1535440364.0;"Theres effectively zero chance that he gave you inside information.Even if he did, you can trade on it as long as you don't pay him kickbacks. It's his responsibility to protect inside information you are not an insider. "
e4xynj6;Gorsuch2;1535438094.0;"Insider trading is a crime because it affects the market.  Depending on the capitalization of the company, your 3k won't affect the market.  It would be a de minimis violation.  It's the same reason they don't prosecute every copyright infringement, or every wage theft violation.  But, you have to wonder why they prosecute every drug violation. "
e4xyhpu;calculman3829;1535437930.0;"I'm sure there are ways to invest in the company if you believe in it otherwise, but as it stands right now it would be insider trading."
e4y1aoi;genericscotch;1535440776.0;"It is but who cares, everyone does it but no one talks about it like bareback full service.  Just don't get caught and don't post about it for fuck sakes."

e4y6oup;SirGlass;1535446379.0;"with being vague on what you learned it is hard to say.If you know "confidential" information like you have the earnings report before release somehow, or the CEO told you they were probably going to get bought out at a 15% premium that probably would be insider tradingHowever you can do your own research on the company and this is kind of a fuzzy area.There are ways to learn or kind of extract non-public information legally .For example lots can be learned from companies on job openings, if for example MSFT is hiring arm engineers you may conclude they may be looking to switch from itel to arm for processors.Or you can simply watch the company, do your own research on how busy the parking lot is ect.That is called independent research and not illegal "
e4yhyeb;darealrobertmcd;1535458751.0;"I wouldn’t do anything because it would set off major red flags at the SEC headquarters if 3k went into the said stock. They’d have to postpone their case they are making again Elon Musk and start investigating you "
e4xz39o;hokageace;1535438532.0;"Don't buy...it would be illegal and not even worth it given your investment amount."
e4y2b5h;Kingpawn87;1535441817.0;"Read update. It is not because the insider is not benefiting from it."
e4y2fgj;Kingpawn87;1535441943.0;"Th u won’t because it is not illegal. No be fit to the insider. See edit 2"
e4y2byu;Kingpawn87;1535441841.0;"I came to the same conclusion! Thanks"
e4y2du5;Kingpawn87;1535441896.0;"In my case it is not insider trading. The insider did not benefit from it. "
e4y2gj2;Kingpawn87;1535441975.0;"It is not illegal in my case. There is no benefit for insider. See edit 2"
e4y7j28;Kingpawn87;1535447247.0;"That was my get around at first. I could disclose the information tomorrow and wait a half hour then buy the stock. After research, I would not be insider trading because there was no benefit for the ceo."
e4y7f8p;Kingpawn87;1535447136.0;"It is an partnership with another company. That is much bigger."
e4y2efg;Kingpawn87;1535441913.0;"Not illegal. See edit 2"
e4y4bri;treebeardsavesmannis;1535443926.0;"How well do you know the CEO? Have you ever worked for him? Ever done a favor? Ever bought him dinner? Will you ever be in a situation with him again where it could be perceived that is he getting some sort of quid for your quo. If so, I wouldn’t act the on information. It’s just too risky. People go to jail for this shit. "
e4y6r6g;SirGlass;1535446447.0;"It doesn't matterRemember Martha Stewart received a tip from her stock broker about a company that was going to post poor earnings, she wasn't an insider but was charged with trading insider information  "
e4y3n3t;SourceHouston;1535443221.0;"Dawg if you’re buying his companies stock he is benefitting from it "

e4y4ulz;Kingpawn87;1535444467.0;"I don’t know him. I work in customer service and met him that way."
e4y74ol;Kingpawn87;1535446835.0;"Martha did not go to Jail for insider trading, those charges were dropped. She went to jail for obstruction. If you read the link in edit two, it says that Martha would not have been convicted of insider trading."
e4y4vd7;Kingpawn87;1535444489.0;"Not according to the courts Edit: There has to be a direct benefit from it to him personally. Like me giving him money or something of value "
e4y8nd4;Kingpawn87;1535448405.0;"Not according to United States v Newman. In order for it to be considered insider trading the person that I get the information from would have to get some material benefit. That person is receiving nothing from me. I will likely never see them again. If you read the link I provided in edit 2 you will agree with me."
DELETED;NoAuthor;-1;DELETED;
e4ydu67;SirGlass;1535453870.0;"So the reason why is the blame fell on her stock broker who gave her the tip and told her she should sell and she agreed.Because the stock broker was the one sharing the info, and not only sharing the info making a recommendation on what to do that was the crime.It would have been a different case if she learned it directly from the CEO then took the infomation her self and sold.She kind of had an escape goat as she said "Hey my stock broker just called me and told me there was going to be some bad news and I should sell so I agreed"At that point she could claim ignorance ; or claim that she didn't know it was insider info as her stock broker never told.So it is a different case.Now in reality 99.99% it would be impossible to put the case on you. First they probably won't even notice, if they did it would be pretty hard to prove you talked and got inside info unless the owner admitted he himself did a crime and told you inside info in what case he would get in trouble so he will not do that.

e4y5kqt;SourceHouston;1535445217.0;"Dude you’re asking people on te internet about insider trading. How about you don’t do it. "
e4y7btm;Kingpawn87;1535447037.0;"It was specific information about working with another company. I googled the partnership and it does not appear to be public"
e4y6ndq;Kingpawn87;1535446335.0;"Yeah true, but then I did my research, which I should have done first. I am very confident that I’m right. Confident enough to trade."

e4y79iy;Kingpawn87;1535446974.0;"He did not pitch me his company. He told me information that would increase earnings in the future."
e4y8s2q;SourceHouston;1535448540.0;"This whole conversation is so bloody stupid. If you think it’s materialNon-public information do not trade on it. "
e4y9f2v;Kingpawn87;1535449203.0;"Read the link in edit 2. As long as there is no benefit to the person who told me the information then it is not illegal. If you don’t trust my link research United States v Neman "

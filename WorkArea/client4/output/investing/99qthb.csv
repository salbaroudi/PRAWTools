e4pvjcw;dying_to_be_vain;1535089276.0;"Intuit had been a phenomenal performer, and a stock I have some regret about passing on in the past.  However, the article doesn't say much about why the CEO and CIO are stepping down.  Is there something more troubling going on, or is this just a changing of the guard at the top?"
e4q2kkg;HaliTheGreat;1535096318.0;"Looks like he wasn't very *in to it.*"
e4q4tsh;danellender;1535098639.0;"Good, maybe his replacement will concentrate on actually improving quickbooks instead of just making it more expensive every year."
e4qljbe;fastfrequency;1535117699.0;"Perfect opportunity to buy another momentarily panic dip"
e4qm4ux;Skiinz19;1535118644.0;"Brad Smith was praised in the book 'Leapfrogging' which first grabbed my attention on Intuit. I'd be curious what his next venture is but he could easily coast for the rest of his life."
e4qnkgh;deelowe;1535121067.0;"Maybe they'll finally make some improvements to mint."
e4r7eg7;pynoob2;1535150850.0;"Intuit is a legacy rent seeking company pretending to be a cloud growth stock. To their credit they've forgone some optimal rent seeking revenue to transition to a saas model. Part of being a multi decade old incumbent is a shitload of internal politics and fiefdoms filled with "lifer" employees. Because of that political hyperactivity who knows what's behind a resignation like this. "
e4q0v1d;Ivanka_Duck;1535094554.0;"\-- *He will stay on as the company's executive board chairman.*I think it literally means he lost the political war within the company if he is not sick or has some other personal issues need to take care of.&#x200B;"
e4qdsef;sometimeInJune;1535107874.0;"It's too *brad*, such a shame. "
e4qgrfo;jdeere_man;1535111232.0;"Slowest software to open ever.  Even on a good computer.  That's the biggest complaint. "
e4qcbfx;hoyeay;1535106277.0;"?QBO is pretty good at everything you need.It’s on par with Xero, and I’d say even better.But yea it does need some good upgrades."
e4qw1t2;dbag127;1535137964.0;"Mint is free and they don't even invest in quickbooks so fat freaking chance the free product gets improved."
e4q5i82;uniqueguy263;1535099355.0;"He ‘s been there for 11 years, I think he’s just done and wants to do other shit with his life "

e4qp46c;workMachine;1535123951.0;"Both of you... OUT! "
e4qzy0b;HaliTheGreat;1535143350.0;"At first I thought his resignation was a rumor, just a *smith.*"
e4qiqek;grackychan;1535113709.0;"It’s actually mind boggling. I upgraded all our company’s machines to i7 7600k’s with 16 gb RAM and Quickbooks is still garbage as far as speed. "
e4qdez8;ticklishmusic;1535107472.0;"One of their issues is that a lot of good industry-specific ERP & accounting software is coming out. Quickbooks can be customized to work for specific industries, but it's expensive and a pain in the ass. Intuit's response to this is to create "Quickbooks for x", but many of those products are pretty basic."
e4rlc8w;wirsteve;1535162515.0;"[Smith made $16 million in 2014 and around $12 million in 2013](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/11/26/intuit-ceo-has-28-million-reasons-to-be-thankful-this-thanksgiving/19547369/)I think you're right. He's definitely sitting on enough to retire and never have to work a day in his life."
e4qdqeg;hoyeay;1535107814.0;"What ERP software is cheaper than QuickBooks ?As far as I know, ERP is 10x way more expensive but I agree.QuickBooks needs to implement more features of ERP/enterprise-level features."
e4qdzo8;need_tts;1535108088.0;"Different industries have different requirements. Every kludge/workaround is an opportunity for competition. It isn't about apples to apples (cost of QuickBooks vs cost of erp) it is about buying an erp and getting the added bonus of replacing quick books. "
e4qimbt;ticklishmusic;1535113561.0;"for stuff like accounting, law and other professional services, there are practice management platforms that combine CRM, workflow and accounting all in one (sometimes they even tack on payments and billing). completely designed with an accountant or lawyer in mind with features for things like trust accounting built in. quickbooks is a jack of all trades, but really a master of none.i probably mis-spoke with ERP's, which are for organizations that have outgrown quickbooks anyways."
e4qi997;thorscope;1535113088.0;"Microsoft Dynamics AX is pretty affordable if it’s packaged with an exchange/ onedrive/ Dynamics CRM/ office software package. "

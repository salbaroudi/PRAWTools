9aa517;cjam93;1535259863.0;Looking to start investing for retirement
9aa517;cjam93;1535259863.0;"Hey guys so my job does not offer a retirement plan currently.  I want to start using Vanguard to invest for this until my company begins to offer this. I talked to a friend of mind who is interested in the same, and he has been looking at VFIAX,  VTSAX, and VBTLX. These seem like a good place to start to me as well, but I have never looked into this type of thing before so any advice you guys have for me I would greatly appreciate. Thanks so much"

e4tv14c;userandaloser;1535260294.0;"Sounds like you're looking in the right place. Depending on your income, etc I would look into opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard and then contribute the maximum yearly allowance ($5500).Since you're just starting to invest for retirement, I hope you are fairly young, so you probably want 90% stocks and 10% bonds. If you have a long time horizon, you may want to consider Vanguard's growth index, VIGRX, which is more volatile but offers higher returns in the long term.edit: You should look at VUGRX not VIGRX"
e4u2npr;lanismycousin;1535268295.0;"You've gotten plenty of good advice so I will also agree with the people saying to open up a Roth IRA and max it out if you can. There are a gazillion options on how you can allocate things but if you aren't comfortable with trying to pick and choose stocks/etfs/funds just use one of the target date funds that most fits your tageted date of retirement. https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/"
e4tzied;Intermountain_west;1535264862.0;"Just get one of Vanguard's retirement-date funds, for example "Retirement 2025" but the one that matches your anticipated date.  It contains vtsax and vtblx, as well as their international equivalents, and is designed to be an all-in-one, set-it-and-forget-it retirement fund."

e4ucn7i;escapefromelba;1535278966.0;"You'll need $10k minimum investment for those Vanguard Admiral funds. But you won't be able to do that your first year as IRAs are capped @ $5500. If you're just starting out and don't have that kind of scratch, you can also get into those funds that require a minimum investment by buying ETFs instead. Or there are comparable funds like those offered by Schwab that are low cost (many as cheap or cheaper than Vanguard) with lower minimum investment requirements.Separately, Fidelity recently announced a couple zero fee index funds with no minimum to invest:[Fidelity ZERO Total Market Index Fund](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31635T708)[Fidelity ZERO International Index](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31635T708)"

I would choose something like VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX (total stock market, foreign stock market, and bonds). Note that you need 10k in each fund to buy admiral shares, so you will likely need to start with either the investor equivalents of those funds or the ETF equivalents.

These seem like a good place to start to me as well, but I have never looked into this type of thing before so any advice you guys have for me I would greatly appreciate.I don't like 2 those funds. the growth rates are terrible. VFIAX is an S&P 500 fund, so you can expect an average 10-11% growth rate. VTSAX has a ~9.9% growth rate, underperforming the SP 500http://performance.morningstar.com/fund/performance-return.action?t=VTSAX&region=usa&culture=en_USVBTLXI don't like bonds, research shows the more bonds you have the more likely you are to burn through a retirement account.https://abcnews.go.com/Business/stocks-bonds-assure-risk-retirement/story?id=23782803my personal policy is to invest only in funds that match or beat the S&P 500 growth rate. 10-11%/year. VTSAX is close, but not quite there. it's not awful, but there are better options. fees matter, but so does growth rate. 11% growth a year with a 1% fee will make you wealthier than 8% growth with a .04% fee. the charts in the link below assume someone maxes a Roth IRA for 30 years. so $5500/year.first example is 11% growth with 1% fee. total? $977k and you paid $242k in fees.second example is 8% growth with a .04% fee. total? $672k and you paid $5k in fees.https://imgur.com/a/A7czVRw"

More people should know about options... They aren't meant to be speculative, they're meant to improve your probabilities of success and hedge against losses. There's absolutely no good reason to not be selling covered calls against any stock you own. That whole idea of "throw your money into vanguard and drop dead" idea is ridiculous unless the individual truly couldn't care less but wishes to see average returns. As for this post, sure it's a fitting answer for a beginner, but if anyone cares to learn beyond what to just throw their money at and die, this guy's covered call idea is the next step.

Max your Roth IRA, take advantage of company matches with 401ks, have your investments/retirement come out automatically every paycheck/monthly/quarterly so you don't have to think about it. If you don't want to do any thinking just put your retirement money into a targeted retirement date vanguard/schwab/etc. fund. Don't have all of your money in any single stock/sector.

9aybjl;AutoModerator;1535486712.0;"If your question is "I have $10,000, what do I do?" or anything similar. There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer* How old are you?* Are you employed/making income? How much?* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?* Any big debts?* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!"

e505ucu;DocMasi;1535527132.0;"I have a simple question, but please forgive my ignorance. I just graduated from professional school and am finally taking control of my finances. 1- 272- employed. 100K a year 3- My main goal is to retire around 60, with enough money for a good lifestyle to travel. 4- I have about 20,000 in savings5- No debt, no big expenses coming so my question is this: I have set up a 401k and Roth IRA, but do I invest the money in my Roth? I have read that active management is rarely successful, so should I invest it with passive management? Or should I just leave it alone in that account? When I am reading online I can't tell if people are considering the Roth IRA alone an investment or if they are talking about taking that money and using it for stocks/bonds/etc? I'm sorry again, this is a whole new world to me. "

e4z3ri7;Skoskk;1535494014.0;"Hello, I am a 23-year-old, employed and making $56k per year in income. I have $25,000 in savings and am looking to gain some interest before a potential wedding in around 18-20 months. I feel like I’m wasting opportunity having the money just sit in savings. That being said I have a very low risk tolerance due to some large payments in the future. Would it be worth it to invest in 6 month treasury bills, buying them a month apart? In summary, 23 years old, employed 56k/year, low risk tolerance, no other current holdings, 18 month time horizon, some big debt later in life. Should I invest in treasury bills for the 18 months so the money isn’t just sitting in savings?"

I currently have 82k in my retail portfolio (AMZN) and I'm saving for a condo in Chicago ~150-170k.My current plan is to take 80k and pull it into a Goldman Sachs saving account once my portfolio value hits 110k in preparation for any potential recession.Is this a logical plan, or am I being too cautious? Are any of you hedging against a recession?"

e4zhian;docbauies;1535506050.0;"37, employed full time anesthesiologist making comfortable living. i max out my retirement 401k/profit sharing. i have a roth ira. my risk tolerance is currently high, not blackjack high, but equities high.  house with a mortgage. cars paid off.  currently holding FCNTX, FSTVX in my Roth, FSIVX in my old retirement account. SCHB, SCHA, smaller amount of SCHF, SCHG and SCHH in my 401k.  my international exposure is about 15% and I am selling off my FSIVX to get more FCNTX because it seems like a more solid performer over the past 1/3/5/10 years.  I just don't see the reason to be investing much of my portfolio in international funds. The lazy portfolio and asset allocation would suggest I should be like 25% for my overall risk tolerance, but it seems like a huge drag on returns and I don't see international bright spots in comparison to US equities.  am I just being a fool and being too overly undiversified? also having a hard time justifying holding bonds or bond funds when there is significant interest rate risk in the near to long term."
e4zj40o;Volte;1535507387.0;"What makes you invest money in the current market? Prices this high really scare me from throwing in more money. Most of the time I just short the market after a couple days of green. So far ive made around a 30% increase doing this over 6 months. I dont see the market going much higher with the trade war going on, stagnant wages, and student loan debt reaching critical mass. The balloon has got to pop at some point. "
e4zkbk5;PopsHolliday;1535508400.0;"I want to help my younger brother invest some of his money. He is 24 and living at home so his costs are pretty low. He just bought a decent used car and is making payments on that. He just got an entry level part time job and is currently taking home about $1,000 a month. Which will hopefully be more in the near future. He has roughly $10,000 in a savings account. He is looking to dedicate $200-300 to savings. I’m thinking he needs to keep some cash in the bank but since losing his job wouldn’t mean he needs to cover rent or anything I don’t think he needs that much. I guess I’m not sure what to tell him as far as how much, if any, should go into a retirement account and if it should be Roth (certainly his taxes will be higher later in his working life). Or should most go into a mutual fund account where his money can grow for use on something like a house down the road. Or both? Also for shorter term investing should it be somewhere like vanguard or betterment. And what should the asset allocation look like. Thanks! I hope I provided about information. "

Then take the monthly car payment to open a vanguard Roth IRA and max it out yearly invested 100% into VTI ETF. Then at some point when I have enough built up to withdrawl all / only the contibutions to pay off my mortgage freeing up another $500 monthly amount? I understand the 100% ETF isn't diversified and is 100% stocks but I'm only 32 and between it and the TSP should that not be diversified enough? "
e4zt6or;IndianaBasshead;1535515860.0;"Looking to start investing. I don't have a finance background and am just now in a position to begin investing. A little about me: I'm 26, recently married, roughly $75k/year income plus my wife makes about $30k. We have separate accounts and expenses. We live in Indiana. My truck is paid off($30k in equity). I owe $10,000.00 on my motorcycle. I owe $120,000 on my home($50k in equity). I have about $10k(would be higher had I not just paid for wedding) in emergency savings and $25k in my 401k.

e505p64;SlimeDragon;1535526995.0;"Half of my retirement portfolio is in cash reserves (from an IRA rollover). Is it wiser to invest in an index fund now or wait until the stock market crashes? The reason I ask is because I am worried that investing now is too risky, mainly because the stock market is hitting all-time highs plus Trumps trade war are making me nervous. "
e50dtjl;Electric24;1535534829.0;"You have to buy something with the money in your Roth IRA otherwise the money just sits there. Some people buy individual stocks/bonds but most here recommend buying some funds that track the market. Depending on whether you use fidelity or vanguard etc would depend on which fund would have no commissions etc.  "
e50dwcj;ServerOfJustice;1535534900.0;"Active or passive is up to you but you need to invest the money. An IRA is just a special account, not an investment in itself. "

To annualize that you plug it in (1+total return)^(1/years) -1: 5.7% per year.  To get real return, you scale by the CPI change: 251.286/239.439 = 1.0495 so total real return was 1.138/1.0495 = 8.4%."
e4zblqp;15q11;1535501015.0;"You can get 1.85% interest at Synchrony (and others check Nerdwallet). They also have 13 month CDs at 2.65%. Both are literally zero risk and would be better than 0%. "
e4zn8x2;billbixbyakahulk;1535510873.0;"You can build what's called a CD ladder.  This is when you buy different CDs with different maturations.  So for example, you could buy 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, 1 year and 2 year CDs.  As the shorter CDs mature, you reinvest them.  This balances short term access to funds with longer term interest rates.  If you have an emergency fund set aside, you might also consider putting the whole amount in a CD that will mature close to your projected date, but I would leave a month wiggle room (i.e. matures at least one month before needed)."
e4zfmza;kiwimancy;1535504418.0;"You should put a lot of it in cash, not because a recession is likely but because your job security is low and you may need the stability of that money."

e4zm6uj;billbixbyakahulk;1535509988.0;"Key features of an emergency fund are: 1) It's liquid. You have access to it very quickly.  2) It's safe. You know it will be there if you need it.  The 'premium' you pay for those two things is low returns.  Your best bet, as the other poster pointed out, is a high yield savings account.On the upside, as your net worth grows, your EF will be such a tiny, tiny spec of your portfolio that you won't care much about the lack of returns on it.  "
e4zmojr;CommentToBeDeleted;1535510394.0;"If you are investing long term, like for retirement, it's generally considered that time in the market is greater than market timing.If you've had good luck so far that's awesome! But understand most everyone has felt at one time or another they had some system or pattern that made them money and what most people eventually realize is they just got lucky.If you're unsure about what to do, hedge your bets a little. You don't have to 100% commit to either approach. If your unsure, put some in now, and put more in later. "
e4zkqyl;billbixbyakahulk;1535508771.0;"Does his job offer a 401k option?Otherwise, my basic advice is he should open a ROTH and fund it to the yearly maximum, and split it between SP 500 and Nasdaq index funds with low expenses (vanguard or fidelity will fit the bill).You're right that since he still lives at home he's got some leeway, but it's never a bad idea to be thinking a few years ahead when he wants to move out, or if he gets a different job and his car is a necessity.

Thanks for putting that into perspective though. I'm thinking a high yield savings account may be best for this as it is pretty liquid and safe, which are the two important factors.Thanks for the feedback.&#x200B;"
e4zm479;PopsHolliday;1535509925.0;"They don’t currently offer a 401k. You think that considering his age 100% equity exposure is appropriate?"
e50epq7;Electric24;1535535659.0;"High interest savings accounts at the very least like Ally. If you open up a money market account and a savings account you can transfer money between the two instantly and the money market account comes with a debit card if you need to withdraw cash quickly for some reason. (Both types of accounts can only have 6 withdraws a month though).There are also some more gimmicky high interest savings accounts that yield more than average but you have some requirements like money being directly deposited into that account or set up for an auto bill pay and 10 debit card transactions a month. Or depending on how much money you have you could also buy 4 week treasury bills. I buy mine through fidelity and some mature every week and automatically buy new ones unless i tell it not to and tbills are state/local tax free."
e4znxnx;ApocalypticGhost435;1535511440.0;"The typical rule of thumb is 100%  - age = % of Stocks to hold in portfolio, the rest being bonds. Again, that's just a random newbie ratio, if he feels adventurous: Hell yeah put it all in stocks (with a ROTH account assuming his tax bracket is low). Definitely recommend Fidelity for this one, just do some research as Tech stocks are booming, but are extremely volatile compared to other sectors, index funds such as the Nasdaq & SP 500 just trail what the "general market" is doing. [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector-breakdown.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector-breakdown.asp)​Retirement saving is great, ROTH IRAs do allow withdraws for first time home buyers. Try to aim for the yearly maximum for Roth IRA in savings and have the rest in liquid'ish state and split that into monthly payments ex: 458 / month straight into a ROTH CD (not that I would recommend a CD) would max it out for the year, rest of the income into fun stuff, and essentials, and try to not spend it.​The point here is starting early is great, and could help a lot in the long run."
e4znz31;billbixbyakahulk;1535511473.0;"At his age and given the historic performance of those index funds, and given his gains in a ROTH will be tax free during growth and withdrawal, yes, I'd go all equities.  That's me, though.  Historically, that has been a slightly more than medium risk strategy, but since he's young he can (and will) go through 3 - 5 major market swings in his lifetime.  I would fund it and, for the most part, forget about it.When he gets further along in his career and gets access to a 401k, he can decrease his overall risk if he wants with lower risk fund selections.

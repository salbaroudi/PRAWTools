9aeiju;jetty_life;1535306529.0;What is your take on the new Communications Services sector
9aeiju;jetty_life;1535306529.0;"Hey everyone,Just wondering what everyone's thoughts are on the communications services sector now that it's been "rearranged" and changed from telecommunications. The new sector includes companies like Disney, Facebook, Netflix, Google, Comcast, etc.I've been thinking about adding VOX to my Vanguard portfolio, considering these new companies were added. What do you guys think?It's hard to judge past performance now because the major holdings are very different. "

e4xeq9c;astearns31;1535420658.0;"There's nothing new about this sector. They were just reclassified, nothing really more to it."
e4xexud;jetty_life;1535420840.0;"Oh, I thought these companies were moved from one sector to another. Doesn't that change what ETFs hold? "
e4xf6by;astearns31;1535421040.0;"They were, but it doesn't affect them at all. Yes, those ETF's have to reallocate but I believe they have already taken effect. "

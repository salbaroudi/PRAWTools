e4wsb2w;icemanabk;1535397743.0;"I use StockTwits.  Basically Twitter for Investors/Traders.  Learn to use the block button.  There are a lot of pumper/bag holders trying to convince you to buy in, and Bears who are shorting trying to scare you off your position.  Trust me on this, if they don't provide articles to claims, or least show you something they're using to support their reasoning, they're just trying to jerk you around.  Otherwise, the amount of articles and content I've seen about specific stocks I'm in is abundant.  Nice to see articles with "10minutes" on them hitting ST feed."

9ave1l;rakxz;1535454405.0;IG in Australia: New Quarterly "Subscription fee" replacing 2 year inactivity fee
9ave1l;rakxz;1535454405.0;"https://www.ig.com/au/share-trading-charges-and-feesWhy punish clients who deal less than 3 times per quarter? Time to find another platform, recommendations welcome.I buy stocks and hold for CG and dividends, I only sell if it bombs or if I need $ flow. I buy maybe 2-3 times per year (tax return, when I get a bonus at work, when I have enough saved up). I understood IGs inactivity fee, after 2 years there's a rolling $18 fee. Fine, I trade a few times each year no big deal. This new "Subscription fee" is predatory greed. I'm not interested in trading up to 12 times per year. Why should anyone be charged as much as $200 per year for simply holding onto their open positions?"

While this sucks for consumers; it makes perfect sense from a business perspective as there are increasing regulatory costs for brokers these days which are not being covered by the ever dropping rate of brokerage."

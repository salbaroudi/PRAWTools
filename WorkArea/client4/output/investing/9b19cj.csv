9b19cj;ProfTeamun;1535508517.0;"So I'm relatively new here but would love to know how I can get a percentage of worth stake in a company. Do I use a platform like forex or plus 500? Do I need to go through a stock broker? I'm in the UK if that helps. Thanks!"

e4zpyf7;DeeDee_Z;1535513148.0;"Does this small business even -have- shares for sale?  If the answer is No, then you're looking to buy something that there isn't any of."
e4zqus8;GreyscaleSunset;1535513900.0;"[Only strong mature companies tend to go public](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-does-going-public-mean/), small public companies with small share prices are called *penny stocks* and are essentially gambling/lottery tickets.See /r/UKInvesting if you want uk specific advice - I use 212trading for individual stocks (of large companies) as trades can cost up to ~£12.50 a pop with a commercial bank or stockbroker.Stocks with small share prices aren't necessarily cheap as it could be a tiny fraction of the company - just like £1 for 50g of chicken isn't cheaper than £5 for a whole chicken."

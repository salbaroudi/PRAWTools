9arfja;sheffieldandwaveland;1535422978.0;"I bought a long term Cronos Call a few days ago for 530$. Im up 220$. Im not sure if I should just sell or wait. I think a lot of investors can relate to this. When do you sell?"

e4xt8st;Project_Zero_Betas;1535432976.0;"> When do you sell?When another investment presents a better risk/reward profile."
e4xqknl;abrahamlincoln20;1535430766.0;"When a position becomes too large on my portfolio (over 10%). When there is a too large upswing in a short period of time with not enough change in fundamentals. When my amd profits were 300%, 600% and 800%. All of these conditions are rarely fulfilled, so I rarely sell. I learned not to do that after most of the stuff I sold at a small profit, skyrocketed shortly afterward. I never sell the whole position in one trade, usually sell about 30% of it. Mostly because this way, I will see at least some of the possible gains, while also locking in some profit."
e4xm0r7;PristineUndies;1535427005.0;"I usually decide to take the profit long after the opportunity has passed and I'm left holding the bag.I'm great a picking winners but never know when to sell."
e4xivci;rebelde_sin_causa;1535424294.0;"For most of my stocks, never. Or, someday when I need the money. But I own some cyclicals for which I intend to try and time a top, probably a few years from now I think. My means of doing so being specific to that business/sector of the market."
e4xsaf9;scodd84;1535432166.0;"Never until retirement, and by then, it’ll be a slow drawdown if I can’t live off dividends by then. "
e4xjldo;hokageace;1535424938.0;"I am not a trader but for short term buys, you should always have an exit price and keep to it. Only way you fight fear when the stock is going down and greed when it is going up."
e4xv57m;sealdragon2;1535434664.0;"Depends on the stock I like to hold very long term but MU has killed me twice after I did not lock in any profits on both run ups. I may be tempted to sell off next run up but for other stocks like Microsoft I am holding for a very long time. If i feel like I made a good amount on a stock and I want to invest the funds elsewhere because I feel like a better opportunity exists  I will take profits. I have not played with options yet and I have made mistakes like every trader that is how you learn."
e4yb40m;baccus83;1535450908.0;"You should know before you invest at what price you feel a company is overvalued. When they are, sell then. Or sell half (or all your profit) and let it ride. Of course you periodically have to re-evaluate."
e4xum53;patricelaviva;1535434185.0;"Usually you should wait a little more than your first impulse to sell at a gain. since we as investors are empirically shown to realize gains too early and hold on to losses for too long. One reason for this is that a loss is perceived as more painful (approximately twice as much) than the pleasure we get from a gain and hence its easier to take the chips of the table for gains because perceived pleasure from further gains will not increase as much as perceived pain from further losses."
e4y1z2u;lotrekkie;1535441467.0;"I'm in a similar boat.  I bough up CGC right after the constellation deal.  I'm up about 43% right now.  I know it'll slow and probably drop pretty soon but think long term.  Do you like the kind of business model Cronos has?  I bought CGC because I think it'll be a big player down the road, especially once it legalizes in the states.  Just hold on and buckle in through the bumps.  But to answer you question I sell a portion when it's too much of my portfolio to negate diversification."
e4y477k;Wendsley;1535443795.0;"I am struggling with this right now... I bought CGC options the night before earnings / constellation deal..my options are at $4 a share and it is now around $21.45They expire in Jan.....Since this company was just infused with 4b in cash, I imagine there will be good press over the next few months and it will continue to rise.If the stock already announced earnings, and you don't think there will be any announcements over the next few months then you might as well sell and lock in your profits. If you like the stock you can watch and buy back on a dip. "
e4y8a57;nealosis;1535448028.0;"Depends on your trading plan. My plan mandates a 1x2 risk/ratio. For every trade I make I risk 1% to earn at least 2%. Times are better than usual lately so I’ve been increasing that to 1x4. As soon as a position gains 4%, I sell. If a position loses 1% then I sell. Always take profits. "
e4yk533;halladay37;1535461879.0;"Use technical analysis, determine when there may a downtrend. Sell if you feel like it is on a downtrend. Research the volume and determine if a lot of volume is being shorted. Determine if it is consolidation or a bearish trend. &#x200B;"

e4xhlw8;BaskinRobinson;1535423099.0;"I would sell and reinvest into something less risky. That $220 gain could just as easily become a $220 loss."

e4xjqq7;ChipmunkDJE;1535425071.0;"If it's stock, hold it. If it's an option, sell at least some of it. Options are way more volatile than stocks. "
e4xzecu;MichaelC2585;1535438843.0;"This is really the best answer. Diversify when risk creates the necessity, or when gains present opportunity."

I used to like trading biotech and pharma because the dd actually interested me but gave up after a while because I stopped having fun with it and started losing money.Are we allowed to post actual symbols here? I wasn't sure what goes since I don't really visit this subreddit much. It was the Randal Kirk companies that made me the most money a handful of years ago. If I would've actually been smart and learned to read charts I would've left with much heavier pockets."
e4xi1ym;IndianaGeoff;1535423482.0;"Then put sale orders in behind the increases.  Then your only risk is a dip with a sharp move up right after.  But an almost 50% gain on an option... I would sell some for sure.  At least then you are playing with the "house's money.""
e4xi3t0;sheffieldandwaveland;1535423527.0;"Thats some good advice. Thanks. "

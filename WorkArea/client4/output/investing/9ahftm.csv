9ahftm;eusouopapao;1535334573.0;"Im finding this company way too good to invest right now, the trade war with china made top chinese companies taking a hit. I've seen some tv analysts spetickal about the future of this company. But overall the company has been performing good. I find it one of the best long term  medium risk stock out there. What are your opinions?"

e4vlo0z;eusouopapao;1535340947.0;" Second quarter earning report shows not only the company is healthy but growing, over time, they made a lot of decisions right such as having strategic partner like tencent and vipshop to compete with alibaba on e commerce space. Revenue as been growing too, some articules sugesting jd is using its profits to reinvest in tecnology, logistics, real state( they own many warehouses for retail purposes), they are literally taking amazon path which wasnt profitable until it was to the point of dominating the retail space completly by reinvesting the profits constantly. They also provide retail space for other businesses. Some articules suggest they have google as partner to improve their business and tecnology solutions. They also sell various merchandises the list is very long, this is a big chunk of their revenue which they look to keep improving for sure. They are literaly building the foundation to ramp up and taking it to the next level. For long term aim JD would be a miss right now. What is your opinion about it?"

9b0sx4;HighYieldJunkie;1535505368.0;Any good distressed debt / high yield bond research services?
9b0sx4;HighYieldJunkie;1535505368.0;"CreditSights is good and theyre increasing their HY coverage, but are there any other good research services? Stan Mounikan's work is good, but its about $4,000 per report, or $20g annually. &#x200B;ReOrg Research, Market Axess, Aranca, and Value Add seem to be viable options, but does anyone have any feedback from using them? I will test them out with trials and demos, but wondering if anyone else has suggestions for credit research on issues rated BB or lower.&#x200B;Thanks!"

e4zijtx;HighYieldJunkie;1535506926.0;"thanks for the reply! I actually havea call set up with reorg in a few hours. DebtWire is great, used to have it, but its $20k a year, a lot for that service, but their tearsheets and what not are good.Thanks again!"
e4zioia;redcards;1535507033.0;"Yeah Reorg is cool, I think their service is more expensive than Debtwire. That could've changed. Aside from breaking news, theres nothing they put together that you can't do yourself though!"

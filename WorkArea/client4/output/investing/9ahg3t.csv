9ahg3t;Hydrolord0;1535334631.0;What are the differences between Fidelity's four US bond index funds (FXSTX, FXNAX, FBIDX, FSITX)?
9ahg3t;Hydrolord0;1535334631.0;"All four funds have fees of 0.025% and no minimum investments. The only difference seems to be that two are "investor's class" and two are "institutional class." And in each class, one is labeled "premium." The institutional premium one (FXNAX) has the highest rate of return by a hair. Is there any reason this one wouldn't be available to me? It gives me the option to buy it, but I'm not sure if there's a catch here. Thank you."

e4vidw0;GaylrdFocker;1535337808.0;"No difference anymore. They reduced the expense ratios and did away with the minimum a couple weeks ago.  They will end up merging all 4 to a single fund."
e4vimbe;Hydrolord0;1535338036.0;"Okay, thank you. Does that mean that if I invest in one now, the funds will automatically transfer over to the merged fund (once they merge)? I'm still new at this."
e4viy7e;GaylrdFocker;1535338357.0;"Most likely yes, but last I checked they had not made up their mind yet.If you have an account with them it's best to call them and ask. They may even know which they are going to keep even if it hasn't been made public yet."
e4vo1am;Hydrolord0;1535343204.0;"Okay, thanks again."

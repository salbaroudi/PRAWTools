The CEO has fucked up big and it will have consequences. "

e4tqz25;dreamingofaustralia;1535256167.0;"In a recent tv interview on cheddar news, there was a follow-up question to one of the partners of this firm regarding success rates. They stated they have about a 50/50 success rate over the decades. These cases are never easy, and it wouldn't surprise me if the majority of the wins are settlements. I have a feeling that Elon will be less likely to settle compared to most other CEO's, similar to how Apple handled their US iBooks antitrust suit (which didn't end well for them.)"
e4trffe;userandaloser;1535256627.0;"Why don't you compare their record to the equally impressive credentials of the law firm hired to defend Tesla?"
e4tlgbg;50calPeephole;1535250593.0;"I'm sorry, I thought this sub was for investing discussion and not wsb bleed over and politicking."
e4trtop;50calPeephole;1535257026.0;"My grandfather owned a successful busniess for decades, one of his greatest pieces of advice to other busniess owners is "Its cheaper to settle"      If TSLA can swallow some pride and settle I think you'll see less volatility in their stock price than a long 2-3 year legal battle. With that said however, a long litigation might play to TSLA's favor when it comes to investor confidence."
e4trmog;igotopinionsppl;1535256831.0;"The best part is, this is just one of the many law suits coming on to the company. "
e4trk57;igotopinionsppl;1535256763.0;"Should I compare Elon to other fraudulent CEOs while I‚Äôm at it? The level of blind faith in the company is too damn high. "
e4tq3d6;EducationalSample;1535255288.0;"Just because he used flowery language doesn't mean this isn't relevant to one of the biggest ongoing stories in investing. "
e4tlkf5;vlc_seller;1535250705.0;"I'm sorry if you $TSLA bulls are offended, but this class-action can clearly have an impact on the company."
e4trzv7;dreamingofaustralia;1535257201.0;"Yes - it is hard to say at this point. Depends what any settlement might even look like. The exxon lawsuit has left that company as a fraction of what they used to be - bad bad bad. A few hundred million? Not a huge deal if Tesla becomes profitable for Q3 onward. More than that? Company would not settle and would probably go to court to push back any potential payments. "
e4tru5a;dreamingofaustralia;1535257039.0;"Why would anyone wish vampire/lawyers on any company? That is a sick way of thinking. Regardless, these suits get combined and piggyback off a main one. Over time, they won't be fighting dozens of suits over the same issue, but just one. Already, some major firms have tried to file suit with the firm mentioned in the original post, streamlining the process. "
e4trr4v;userandaloser;1535256954.0;"What blind faith? He hired a best in the world law firm to defend him against other best in the world law firms. Who knows how it will end. "
e4tn5fl;50calPeephole;1535252273.0;"I dont even have a stake in $TSLA    The class action might have a effect on the company- to date none of the other class actions have. Perhaps you might want to start the investing conversation about how the lawsuit will effect $TSLA's reporting such that you can be contributing to an investing discussion? "
e4ttps9;igotopinionsppl;1535258926.0;"When a company/company management commits fraud, lawyers are used to penalize them. Sort of a check and balance. "
e4tsesc;igotopinionsppl;1535257617.0;"I‚Äôll tell you who will win: the lawyers. Not the investors and certainly not Elon. This was a result of an acid trip. "
e4tu5gy;dreamingofaustralia;1535259377.0;"Time will tell, but I‚Äôd bet good money that the sec case will be related to intent to manipulate. They will review all his internal communications and search for proof of that. Without that, they have no case. We will soon find out if they find anything. Until then, your general statement of securities fraud is meaningless and uneducated to any securities attorney who reviews this. Right now they have enough external evidence to investigate, but we don‚Äôt know what they will find in internal comms. The entire case will revolve around this both criminal and civil. Without knowing what he was telling people behind closed doors, everything is speculative. If watching a business get sued gets your heart pumping and gives you pleasure, go to law school. Benefits no one except the lawyers. "
e4tuxf2;igotopinionsppl;1535260187.0;"Let‚Äôs say SEC don‚Äôt find anything. Elon still tweeted that funding is secure and then many more tweets relating to the subject without any indication that he‚Äôs speculating or that funding is secure. This still means that Elon mislead the investors and the shorts. "
e4tvdp9;dreamingofaustralia;1535260663.0;"That may make common sense to you, but it‚Äôs not how securities law works in America. There isn‚Äôt an sec definition for secured and there won‚Äôt be a Judge trying to decipher what funding secured means. They will focus on intent and see if any communications back that up. If they find an email from Elon to a coworker saying ‚Äúman watch this, about to jack up our stock price‚Äù then of course he would be in trouble. But they need to find a piece of evidence like this. "
e4tvu5e;Juniper00e;1535261132.0;"Perceiving an Intent to mislead on a public message might be enough. This is why major companies have lawyers as spokespeople. You have to be careful with the stuff you say. Especially when you are THE FACE of the company you are talking about."
e4tw7vy;dreamingofaustralia;1535261519.0;"I‚Äôm not saying it was smart to say what he did:  obviously it isn‚Äôt. But his tweet is not enough for anything except to begin an Investigation and force discovery. No verdict would ever be delivered over just that tweet. They need explicit proof that he made that tweet to influence the price. Typically, this is hard to prove. I‚ÄômNot sure why this is so difficult to understand? Right now the only people in the world who know if they have a legit case are the people at the sec who will receive internal evidence. I doubt Tesla has even given anything at this point as companies typically ask for extensions past the normal 2 week request timeline. "

9as1nr;mandor1784;1535427380.0;"Feex rates my standard (read: non crypto) investments with a 5.5% return to be worth $1.72m when I retire in 33 years.Based on that figure alone, would anyone feel comfortable mostly letting it ride and not futzing with additional investments?"

e4xmzly;CapitalNumb3rs;1535427818.0;"Based on my math, you have about $300k invested right now.Have you considered investing more and retiring before 33 years from now?"
e4ywiwv;FIinvestor;1535485835.0;"Yes. The concept you are thinking of is Coast FIRE. Check out any of the financial independance boards for more info. CoastFIRE is essentially, accumulating all you need to retire in the future without needing to invest any more (just let your nest egg grow).Now there are two other things to consider: - Investing more money could help you to retire earlier and/ or with more money."
e4xn1r8;mandor1784;1535427867.0;"Of course. I was simply asking evaluation if I didn't. "
e4xoqz2;mandor1784;1535429278.0;"Also, and related: if I were to retire sooner, what would you say the $ goal would be? AKA - Aim for (this amount) to retire."
e4ywn6j;FIinvestor;1535486003.0;"Trinity Study published a 4% save withdrawl rate. Meaning if you have 40k in expenses, you need 1M to be able to withdraw 40k a year indefinitly. However, most people retiring early reduce their save withdrawl rate to 3-3.5% as a factor of safety.So, as a starting point, try to figure out what your expenses are now and in the future. Divide that amount per year by 0.03 and that's probably a good starting point to target."
e4xp4r5;CapitalNumb3rs;1535429579.0;"Depends on how early you'll retire (how long you'll need to live off the money) and how much you spend (now/at retirement) per year."

e5086zv;WjorgonFriskk;1535529365.0;"I have regrats* too. Sold Amazon @ $800. Sold Adobe @ $100. Not selling my dividend stocks at a big gain before the bull market kicked into high gear and people sold off their dividend stocks to get into growth stocks. Dumb. I have learned to “take profits” if I have decent gains but I rebought into Amazon and am sticking to it. "

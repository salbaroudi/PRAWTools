9alcko;rrrsssttt;1535366557.0;"I'm so confused trying to understand the difference between the two.  Can someone please guide me.  And which method is the preferable one to opt for?"

e4wff1e;Rkm246;1535372840.0;"I believe OP means what is the difference between purchasing on vanguards site vs buying elsewhere. Such as buying VTI on vanguard vs buying it on Robinhood"
e4wfloo;sjs31;1535373097.0;"There’s usually a commission if you buy their funds/etfs through another broker, and usually you can’t get admiral shares. ETFs have the same expense ratio as admiral shares, though.  "
e4yx94h;FIinvestor;1535486839.0;"Vanguard is a broker meaning they allow you to buy and sell stocks and funds through them. Vanguard also have  their own funds they allow you to buy commission free (they only get MER) through them. You can buy non Vanguard stocks and funds through Vanguard for a small commission ($5?). Similarly, other brokers typically allow you to buy and sell their own funds through them for free as they make money on the MER though often charge a commission for buying and selling other funds.Another difference is vanguard allows you to drip their funds, inclduing fractional shares while if you hold a Vanguard fund at another brokerage you may not be able to."

e4wafwc;willthewarlock23;1535366806.0;"Most other places require a fee to handle the transaction but if you have an account on their site you get no fee. So if you want to invest in various things like a vanguard and wisdom tree etfs most people pay the fee so they don't have tons of accountants. But if you're investing mostly/all into vanguard just get a vanguard account. "

e4wcnpj;mbrasher1;1535369330.0;"I don't think you can buy a share of Vanguard stock.  Iirc, it is a mutual association owned by the funds, so it tries to keep expenses low.  Some other mutual fund families make money loaning stocks to sell short (permitting some investors to sell shares they do not own, in the expectation they will go down, and be bought back for a profit). Vanguard lets its funds receive the profits from that activity, which has meant that some VG funds outperform their benchmarks (typically, VG funds track a market index such as the S&P 500 as a benchmark). Other fund companies are NOT run for the benefit of the investors."

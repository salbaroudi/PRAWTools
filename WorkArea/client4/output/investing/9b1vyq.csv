e4zsc6m;bannercoin;1535515145.0;"Another reason companies should stop giving guidance altogether. Damned if you don't hit targets. Company executives don't have crystal balls."
e4zvkvw;bms0430;1535517882.0;"If Tesla does hit its targets, it's by claiming a "per week" production figure that they only achieved for a single week.  Maybe not securities fraud but it is misleading."
e4ztgno;redderist;1535516096.0;"While there are some legitimate reasons to support providing guidance on a less frequent basis (yearly or twice-yearly), I'm not sure this article or outcome provides support for that view. It's a contested topic but not super relevant here."
e4zvjvc;bannercoin;1535517858.0;"It's a way to avoid these type of lawsuits in the first place and goes to show that investors shouldn't rely on guidance anyway since it could be wrong without consequence."

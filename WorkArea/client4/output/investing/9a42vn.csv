9a42vn;rdudejr;1535198883.0;"Just getting into crowdfunding myself. Anyone talk/discuss that around here?"

e4sxmsd;dvdmovie1;1535221486.0;"No. I have no interest in getting into investments with zero liquidity unless they get bought or go public, neither of which is likely for the majority of what's on these sites. "
e4sqpqo;WizOnTheFence;1535206357.0;"I’d treat it like angel investing; if you are cool with losing it all, go for it. If one makes money, yay!"
e4sx76w;pk1234553;1535220475.0;"I have been using mintos for a while now and I am pretty happy."
e4stew9;greatm31;1535211674.0;"No. Don’t do it. Ever. All these sites way underestimate their risks. There’s a reason those companies are seeking money from tiny outfits. It’s because they can’t raise it in normal ways because they’re too risky. "
e4sq1sf;rustycrypto;1535205176.0;"Any example crowdfunding platforms you are exploring and care to share your thoughts"
e4sq2yu;WizOnTheFence;1535205231.0;"Why are you interested in the space?"
e4tcw9y;rjm101;1535242164.0;"The liquidity is low however sites like [seedrs.com](https://seedrs.com) have secondary market which give you an easy way to sell your shares without needing to wait for the company to either go public or get acquired. It's better than nothing."
e4tajn6;rdudejr;1535239821.0;"Yes it’s not a good home for your nest egg for sure. I actually like the low liquidity. It’s shielded from volatility of the market and I don’t need this money for 30 years. "
e4tacy7;rdudejr;1535239630.0;"What is your RoR? How I this different from lending club?"
e4tczpi;rjm101;1535242259.0;"I guess it's how you interpret crowdfunding but isn't that more P2P lending?"
e4tai2v;rdudejr;1535239778.0;"Yes I could see your point. For me this is like dipping my toe into angel investing."
e4twllp;rjm101;1535261906.0;"Some use normal methods too and also use crowdfunding to bring awareness. What better way to get people onboard with your product/service than by making them feel a part of the company by allowing them to own shares in the company? It definitely helps with the network effect. The startup gets funding and essentially free marketing at the same time and gets to engage and identify the level of demand for their offering."
e4sqhr7;rdudejr;1535205963.0;"This is my first day really digging. After some googling I came across wefunder, and there are 2 deals I like (hotelsbyday and kwame baah sandals).  I looked at a few other sites like microventures but there was nothing there I liked.  The kwame deal is 10% revenue share up to 2x and the hotels deal is a discounted convertible note. 25% I think with $5mm cap. The catalyst for me was, a few months back a local bbq and beer place uncle Billy’s did a round on microventures.  It was a revenue share, 10% up to 1.5x, for a new line of whiskeys. I wanted in that deal bad but missed the cutoff - was too busy to get my cash in order to invest. I needed to make the investment out of a solo 401k and just took too long to drive to the bank and open the trust account. Anyways, that’s what I’m looking at today. "
e4sqk4w;rdudejr;1535206078.0;"I love the space. I think it’s the next big thing. It’s all the upside of micro cap stocks but with the opportunity to really get to know the business and maybe do a deal that’s local. And the minimums are not bad, $100-250 usually. Plus I found a way to do it out of my retirement money so - doesn’t feel like it’s competing with my budget."
e4tesnm;pk1234553;1535244089.0;"Yes it is but a lot of people are calling it crowdlenfing/crowdfunding "
e4tytaq;greatm31;1535264131.0;"In angel investing you get access to all financial data and sales info. You’ll know everything about them. You’ll also have the ability to direct activities. If things go bad you might even have preference with liquidation. With crowdfunding you’ll get limited information and likely get $0 back if the company doesn’t sell enough one quarter and go bankrupt. Or they’ll just decide not to pay you back and you’ll have no power to force them to pay you. It’s basically a scam. "
e4tymhe;greatm31;1535263933.0;"Crowdfunding like via Kickstarter is fine because users are only pre-ordering or just supporting a company. But if people think they are really going to get a return on investment via one of these other sites they’re nuts. You have no power and if anything goes south you will be the last person paid. And small companies fail all the time. Seriously, crowdfunding is basically a scam. "
e4sqskx;rustycrypto;1535206497.0;"> a new line of whiskeysEither I have read this comment before or seen video of something very similar. I recollect something on this lines."
e4sqtfn;rustycrypto;1535206541.0;">  out of my retirement moneyIs it too much risk, playing with your retirement money"
e4udrx9;rdudejr;1535280237.0;"I’m not sure that’s true. At least the deals I’ve looked at there are SEC filings with pro forma financials. Having been part of a few angel deals on the selling side, it’s about the same if not better due diligence. "
e4u0bmj;rjm101;1535265729.0;">You have no power and if anything goes south you will be the last person paid. And small companies fail all the time.This applies to any stock you hold whether it's public or private unless you some big institional investor. I'm not doubting that investing in startups is risky. This is obvious.>But if people think they are really going to get a return on investment via one of these other sites they’re nuts.  >  >Crowdfunding like via Kickstarter is fine because users are only pre-ordering or just supporting a company.People can and do get returns. Either the company gets aquired, goes public or you sell your shares on the secondary market which some of these platforms offer. I've sold private equity on the secondary market for 4x returns in the past. Yes it's risky and yes like 95% of the startups I see on these platforms are companies I'm not keen on myself however the companies listed on these platforms can vary greatly from startups that haven't even launched yet to already well known fintech companies that have big institutional investors already behind them. I prefer doing this compared to using something like kickstarter to buy a product because you're taking on a lot of risk with little return in comparison.&#x200B;"
e4tafxw;rdudejr;1535239715.0;"There are so many whiskey deals. I like the uncle Billy’s deal because 1) you got a $100 gift card on $500 investment and 2) I go there all the time. Restaurants in Austin do really well especially that kind. So does local alcohol. Deep eddy and Tito’s both come from here. I’m sure you’ve seen that in the shelf. "
e4ta9dl;rdudejr;1535239528.0;"Eh I don’t think so. I don’t have a ton saved, maybe $10K. I own a startup myself so most of my future net worth is tied up in that being successful. You can make little $250 bets on these, you get a product, and I my criteria for investment is post-product and post-revenue. For instance, for the shoe company I was looking at, the guy lives 3 hours away from me (so probably could go have coffee with him if I wanted to) and he’s using the money to expand the factory. Did $130k in sales last year and around 100 the year before that. For me, this is Dipping my toe into angel investing. "

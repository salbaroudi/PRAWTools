9aumoi;urriola35;1535447758.0;"Iâ€™m trying to figure why this stock has been such an under performer in the energy space. The company is almost 7% of the XLE and near 52 week lows when oil is almost $70 a barrel."

e4yi7dc;bobskizzle;1535459077.0;"Also BP Wells doesn't really like dealing with them (at least offshore). I've seen them get booted off of a bunch of rigs in lieu of other players who were willing to put together less bundled contracts (though some bundling is now the norm).Also a crappy corporate culture, similar stupidity to that exhibited by GE. They're French, after all. ðŸ˜Ž Then they bought Cameron, which is almost entirely capex based (except the spares business which can bring in ~5-7% residuals on their installed base per annum). They dominate the offshore drilling BOP space (which got obliterated in 2015-2016) but the subsea tree space is facing a lot of competition from FMC and Aker."

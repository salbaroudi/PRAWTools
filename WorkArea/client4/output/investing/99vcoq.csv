99vcoq;PotatoKingIV;1535124025.0;After your first year of investing did you face gains or losses and what did you do differently going forward?
99vcoq;PotatoKingIV;1535124025.0;"My first year of investing is coming to a close and, although I've learned my own lessons along the way, I'm curious to hear what lessons others have learned and how they dealt with them going forward."

e4qpajm;lame_corprus;1535124301.0;"I got a 20% return and got super confident in my stock picking ability which later bit me in the balls"
e4qpoqu;resubleu;1535125083.0;"Did really well my first year, then got cocky trying to make a really quick buck and learned a very valuable lesson."
e4qxe6t;Demonstratepatience;1535140018.0;"I did a ton of research in my first year. Took classes. Analyzed a ton of data. Spreadsheets out the wazoo. Some stocks I crushed it (90%+ returns) some I got destroyed on (-30% returns). Some politics screwed me on. In the end, I’m up about 12% and should have just invested in an index fund. That’s all I do now. Make the same return, highly diversified, and no effort to manage. "
e4qy26a;gronkspike25;1535140956.0;"I lost money investing in products I didn’t fully understand due to faulty research. Since I read Peter Lynch’s book I made a decision to only invest in companies that I either have a very good understanding of, or in companies who’s products I use. Since then I have done very well. I figure if I can’t figure out why a product may be useful for me than other people may feel the same way. "
e4rk45r;Hablamanos3;1535161498.0;"%-wise it was very good, but i must have made the equivalent of like 10 cents an hour"
e4qs1no;oberlre02;1535130047.0;"my first year was a disaster, 40% loss lol... too optimistic and bad luck at same time"
e4rlzc4;streetsofrageTWO;1535163062.0;"My first year I was down huge. Fortunately it was unrealized losses.  That was in 2012/2013.  And the stock I held was AAPL which I still own."
e4qugi4;steafo;1535135104.0;"I’m in my first year now. I’m not really in enough to hurt if I lose everything I’m treating it as a learning exercise. How much money did everyone use to “learn” in their first year?"
e4r54zk;TheGarbageStore;1535148822.0;"My first year in investing was in Bitcoin in 2011.  Bought at $30, sold most of it on the way down, made profit on it in 2017."
e4reds6;epicdeartime;1535156757.0;"Been investing for 1 year and 2 days to this date and I have made a 27.41% return. I'm satisfied with the results but still a bit regretful for stupid decisions I made earlier on. I actually wrote little assessments on bad investments and choices to sell off. I'm pretty certain that if I did not sell any of my old investments I would have had a 40%+ return.. Big lesson I learned is don't get TOO greedy.Going forward, I decided to hold on to my investments longer (only been in the market a year... ha!), do a little more due diligence, and have more patience. "
e4rnxts;rageingnonsense;1535164737.0;"I did great my first time 10 years ago with a nintendo investment before wii launch. I then bought some Intel and forgot about it for like 7 years. That got sold, and I bought and. I spent 2017 down about 30%. However, today I am up about 45% in aggregate. I hardly ever sell at a loss, only if I don't have faith in the company or industry, and realized I made a mistake.I dont play with a lot of money though, just the amount I am willing to lose or baghold for a decade. I also don't have confidence in most of my picks, I always feel like I could learn more, and make more educated investment decisions. "
e4s3qbf;Bankerror100;1535179091.0;"Very poorly, I picked stocks including penny stocks. However I think those lessons were good to learn especially considering, you use less funds your first year investing than you are likely to use investing in later years. After that I've done very well but nothing crazy. "
e4sbthf;hibbert0604;1535187484.0;"I'm not quite a full year into it, but I'm currently down 15%. I was down 20 though. I've started making better decisions, I think but I still feel like I'm never going to make it out of the red. "
e4qplqj;prime5;1535124912.0;"Turned into a Hog the first year, and then got slaughtered.."
e4qzzcr;jpnlabs;1535143392.0;"I added some decent ones. But what l learnt over an year is stock picking is not worth it for an average investor.  The performance is almost same as if I had invested all the money in an broad market index. Going forward I will be only investing in indexes. BABA and FB were the ones which brought me down."
e4r12me;directheated;1535144643.0;"Switched from naked calls in 2017 (did *extremely* well off this) to nearly all risk defined trades in 2018. I wouldn't do anything differently with my long portfolio it's bog standard mix of index funds, plus stocks I have researched very well. "
e4ran98;JimBoonie69;1535153617.0;"like others i played with fire, got bit , hit some winners ( i successfully shorted the market for like 150 bucks haha i had no clue what i was doing). Still holding a bag or two but nothing major, couple hundred bucks in losses. Since then loading up to mutual fund my SNXFX fund is up like 27%. I got in at good time in 2014 no really insane corrections or anything, 27% since then!"
e4rx1h9;Darkseidz;1535172703.0;"The first year I took losses in companies I wasn't familiar with due to reading those silly Motley Fools/Zacks sites, OR I sold too quick due to some market declines. Afterwards I stuck with companies I was familiar with, understood roadmaps, and their respective financials--and, I decided to hold long term and not be so reactive but rather buy up more due to market declines. Up about 50k in last 2 years since."
e4s0j9f;lagerbaer;1535175918.0;"Gains, entirely due to ~~this crazy long bull market~~ my genius investing prowess."
e4sa5ai;cardomin;1535185735.0;"Started in 2009 so I just kept buying."
e4sjud1;Runner0909;1535196450.0;"My first year I bought share in a low-cost Vanguard mutual fund, got a decent gain. One thing I would have done differently was to buy a small amount of shares monthly instead of buying all at once.  "
e4rqcxl;7thief7;1535166823.0;"My lesson was letting the news and drama pass by, before jumping into a stock at ATHighs.  Holding unto your Cash is still a great position. "
e4rxpaq;Give_Praise_Unto_Me;1535173293.0;"First year started April 2009 so you do the math"
e4qshpe;dontsayaword123;1535131012.0;"Haven’t hit the half year mark yet but learning loads. Spreading around property and infrastructure, our national airport, some overseas managed funds. Have a chart drawn up predicting how much I’ll have put into each, and any potential returns. Nothing on a serious level yet, but testing the water. Most is high risk, a little medium. Good fun so far. "
e4qpvy6;Archer_F;1535125493.0;"Maybe, don’t put your balls near the investments? Or just start wearing pants? "
e4qqwrs;sunquestai;1535127629.0;"Dito"
e4qtkqw;Chaosender69;1535133323.0;"Sounds like options"
e4r3u2r;ElvisDimera;1535147583.0;"why not a mutual fund or an ETF? Why an index fund?"
e4rcmra;pdiddy117;1535155274.0;"Oh dam "
e4rwiyq;farmallnoobies;1535172238.0;"I'm not counting my 401k as active investing, as I mainly just picked the best indexes I could and left them.For my active investments outside of that, I used $15k.  Picked two stocks and a corporate bonds fund.  In the first year, I netted $450, or 3% up.  Considering the extra risk I took, and that the s&p earned over twice that in the same period, I don't currently think it's a win.  I'm curious to see how the picks fare during a bear market though."
e4qrdwm;lame_corprus;1535128633.0;"My broker ordered me to take off my pants and close my eyes for reduced commission fees"
e4quvzb;resubleu;1535135925.0;"Actually, trying to time the bottom of the 2014/2015 oil market crash and going all in into one position, with the intention to pull out shortly after a rebound. I've already sold 90% of that position at a serious loss, and I'm still waiting for that rebound with the other 10%."
e4rfnbk;Demonstratepatience;1535157818.0;"Mural funds typically have higher expense ratios because a money manager is updating the portfolio on a regular basis and making changes. Index funds typically follow an index (SP500, etc.) and are passively managed (no one updates the index day-to-day). Because no one is managing it, you don’t have to pay a management fee (or usually it is a VERY small percentage).ETFs are more complicated but they can follow an index or a sector or multiple sectors or a bunch of variations. Usually ETFs that follow and index will have similar expense ratios, but can be taxed different. Usually index funds are taxed as at lower rates than an ETF. *Note that expense ratios (or operating fees) are not the same as commissioning fees. Commissioning fees are fees that are applied when buying/selling an asset. Expense ratios are fees that are applied to maintain an asset. "
e4r3w65;wilshire8899;1535147640.0;"Lol"
e4qsime;snaxks1;1535131067.0;"Sounds like my GF.  Is yours a broker too?"
e4s77jb;1stBaronKelvin;1535182654.0;"Don't feel bad. A lot of richer and smarter people in the industry did the same thing and lost their shirts. "
e4r3xoo;ElvisDimera;1535147681.0;"im not joking btw, im new to this so forgive me if that is stupid"
e4qsuzc;lame_corprus;1535131804.0;"Nah this is an old fat man"
e4r4vhz;str8upnobs;1535148577.0;"An ETF and an Index fund are one in the same. Spend some time here. It'll teach you some of the "ropes" so to speak. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.aspSome people on here can be snobbish dicks to new people that don't know what's going on, or are asking a simple question."
e4r4lcm;wilshire8899;1535148312.0;"All good brotha.An index fund is a collection of stocks.An Index fund could be an ETF or a mutual fund.ETF’s and mutual funds are pretty much the same, except ETFs you can day trade. Mutual funds you cannot. Both investment vehicles though. "
e4qswpc;Archer_F;1535131908.0;"I need an adult"
e4qsxnv;snaxks1;1535131967.0;"Haha, well homosexuality is accepted nowadays."
e4r8vyt;ElvisDimera;1535152126.0;"So something like VTSAX would be an index fund and a mutual fund?"
e4rodb0;rageingnonsense;1535165109.0;"Another key point is that an index fund tracks an index. For instance, the s&p 500 is an index that tracks the biggest 500 us corporations. Therefore, an s&p 500 index fund seeks to contain the stocks of those 500 companies. If one company gets knocked off the list, the fund sells those shares, and buys shares in the company that replaces the one knocked off.There are a lot of indexes though, not just the 500. Actively managed funds don't necessarily follow an index, they may just use different strategies trying to "beat" the index. Most fail at this over time. Getting rich quick in the market is a rare thing. "
e4rald0;wilshire8899;1535153571.0;"Yes. VTI is equivalent to VTSAX, but it’s an ETF. They both track the entire stock market. "

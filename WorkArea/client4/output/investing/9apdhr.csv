I hope this also would benefit the rest of Central America.The best way to curb issues with illegal immigration is to work with them to develop their economies, and emphasize trade between North, Central, and South America  It is the most humane way, it is the most bipartisan way, it is the best solution to illegal immigration that everyone can like, besides China."

Competition is generally good for the consumer because it lowers monopolistic powers, it increases innovation and lowers prices.2. Another reason is, that all import or export taxes distort your optimal consumer decision: If you would like to buy a European car and the state is putting a 20% tax on European cars, the state is interfering with your optimal choice (optimal, because that's what you would have chosen with no interference). You might now buy an American car without a tax - because you value that American car higher than a European car with a price increase by 20%. But it's still not your optimal choice. So your utility is lower with the American car, then with the tax-free European car (otherwise you would not have wanted it in the first place).&#x200B;Thats why in almost any scenario free trade agreements are always good for the consumers. But there is no big consumer lobby in contrast to lets say for american car manufacturers. Thats why politicians usually hear the Lobby from the producer side. But for the welfare as a whole, which involves producers+consumes, free trade usually increases welfare. Almost every economist in the world would give you this same answer. &#x200B;&#x200B;"

e4xhsa3;3yearstraveling;1535423249.0;"Okay here's a thought experiment for you. Ford makes $5000 dollars on Ford focus. New tariffs force more American labor which increases the cost of the Ford focus to build by $2500. Now Ford has the option to either A increase the cost of the Ford focus by $2500 or only make $2500 on each Ford focus. Let's say that the extra $2500 puts the cost of a Ford focus at the same cost basis of a Honda Civic. SO now Ford focus is directly competing with what some would be to view as a more quality car. So why would anyone run out and now buy a new Ford focus instead of a arguably more reliable and nicer Honda Civic when they are the same price? Of course there will be some people who go out a buy a Ford focus, but if you don't think there are TEAMS devoted to pricing cars off of their competition you're an idiot. Ford will need to decide if they are going to only make $2500 on each focus and cut fat somewhere else in the company or they want to potentially sell less focuses at the same profit for each car.

9axyob;Anonyme71;1535483284.0;"I feel like being financially independent and build your own company is clearly linked. Is it common to achieve financial independence without do this ? "

e4yv6od;ScheerschuimRS;1535483768.0;"Theres multiple ways of achieving financial independence. Making $100,000 a year at a corporate function and being smart with investments will get you there too. Generally you want to focus on creating passive income streams."

e4ywxg9;phugit;1535486399.0;"Not sure I agree with "clearly linked" in your post.Not all entrepreneurs are FI, in fact I would say they work harder for less in the short term with belief in long term (payout/buyout/etc).  But not all will get that payout or FI.  Just setting up a LLC and building something isnt a sure path to FI.Like others post, save as much as you can in 20s/30s and dont get sucked into get rich schemes or wow my friend has x bedroom house.  Then yes you can have FI as you get older into late 30s/40 etc.Live simple young and save as much as possible so later you can have true freedom."
e4yx186;deathdealer351;1535486543.0;"Depends on what you consider financial independence is.One may say no matter what your income is living within your means. Dont carry high intrest credit card debt. Have 6 mo pay liquid, the persuit of stuff is slavery.There are others who belive he who dies with the best toys wins.But ya totally you can work Corporate and be very independent. Dont carry credit card debt. Invest 10-15% of your pay, invest at least to match in a 401k, save 10-15% till you get enough money in the bank that you can tell your company to gtfo or survive on a layoff.Also associate with like minded people, the ones trapped in slavery of credit card debt and the persuit of stuff will drag you down. In a very short period of time you will be in a much better position in live than 75% of the people working with you."

e4z5sf4;billbixbyakahulk;1535495896.0;"It's not required that you be an entrepreneur or own your own business to become financially independent.  I'm technically FI based on my current savings and spend rate because my investments earn more than my monthly expenses.  I continue to work, however, because I do anticipate some amount of lifestyle inflation in the coming years, and also (mainly) for security, as the gains of the last decade can't be assumed to continue forever.  I'm also still in my prime earning years, so quitting now would make no sense: pound for pound, I'm currently making the "easiest" money in my career versus effort.There's a lot of information out there about getting to FI for "normal people", but the most basic aspects are:1. Start saving and investing at a relatively young age.  Mid-late 20s is ideal.  This is typically when a young person's career starts to significantly advance and they see their disposable income likewise increase.  Many start later, say, mid 30s.  It's still possible if you make good money, are willing to lower your lifestyle, or some combination of both.2. Carefully manage debt.  Some are at a significant disadvantage if they took on a lot of student loan debt. The average SL debt is around 40k, and while that's a significant amount, if one is advancing in his her career and keeping lifestyle in check, it should be possible to pay off within 5 - 7 years at most.  My old roommate got his first white collar job around age 24 and got a second job at a sandwich place.  Between living frugally and throwing every spare dollar at his student loans, he was able to pay off 60k in 2 years.  3. Keep lifestyle inflation under control.  Everything from coffee to phones to computers to rent to cars.  All this is within your control.  You don't need to live like a poor person but if you like to live a "pretend rich" lifestyle fueled by debt, it will never happen.  4. Be realistic if you plan to start a family.  Being married with a like-minded FI partner is ideal.  Single is the next most ideal.  Married with kids with likewise FI partner is next in line.  Married with kids with a partner who is not FI-minded is the worst case.  If you have kids, there are few "lean" approaches to FI, i.e. you can't just clip coupons to FI.  You need to be fairly high earning, I would say 2x median income for your area, and/or have a plan to relocate from a high cost of living area to a low one as part of your FI plan.  With working remotely on the rise, this becomes more and more viable.This is obviously skimming the surface but if the above sounds reasonable, it may be possible for you."

My brother flipped pizza for 9 years, took a sales job that’s 100% commission and YTD he said he’s made close to $120k.I’d say it’s more about getting damn good at a skill and continue to get better at it"
e4yy7e9;Turicus;1535488063.0;"I think entrepreneurship allows you to take more risk, so the upside can be higher than employment. However, a lot of businesses also fail, and you are left with nearly nothing. If you want to get really rich, entrepreneurship is the way to go. Very few employed people make millions.If you get a high-paying job, live well within your means, and set aside a large part of your income, you can still make it."
e4yyuz5;aron2295;1535488855.0;"I guess it depends on what your idea of “financial independance” Some of my friends would look to live in a rural area in a modest ranch house and want to be able to hunt and fish for fun. Were in college so I think if they graduate, get a solid job right out the gate and save a good chunk, not even half, but like 20%, that’s possible to do. Others might hear that phrase and think that means they own a beach house in LA and a condo in NYC and drive a Ferrari and wear designer clothes and eat at Michelin Star restaurants. So in that case, you’ll likely need to start some very successful companies. Think about reddit’s favorite profession, engineering. You graduate high school, go to college for 4-5 years and you start working full time after that and your first job pays $60,000. That’s wonderful, but your livelihood is tied to that job. You’re almost at the mercy of whoever hired you, say Lockheed Martin or General Motors. If you want more money, you’ll need to bust your ass and get promoted. And there likely is an income cap, I don’t know engineering that well but let’s just say $300,000 / year at GM. You could be the greatest engineer of all time and GM could sell a billion cars a year but your salary will cap out at $300,000 assuming you have that top engineering position. Let’s say your buddy also graduated in the same class as you but wanted to do his own thing. He works for an exisiting company for a while to learn the industry and gain expierence but he leaves to go start his own company. He does well on his own. The workload gets heavier and he hires a few employees. Now the company can take on more work and bring in more revenue. He’s at the top so he’s earning the money from his own work, and then getting a cut from his employees. And he starts buying houses with all this money and he rents them out. So now he has his money, his employees’ money, and money from his renetal homes coming in. Now he’s very well known in the industry and someone wants to start a new business with him. So now, he has his original business, his new buisness and the rental homes. He’s raking in a million a year! That’s really simplifying it but do you see?That’s why people say becoming an entrepenuer is the path to financial independance."
e4z4hr4;cmiovino;1535494699.0;"If we define "financial independence" as having enough money or passive income to not have to actively work anymore, then no, you most certainly don't need to be an "entrepreneur" or own your own company. Honestly, the vast majority of people that start small businesses I know put a lot of time and money into it just to have it fail or break even. If you're going to go that route, you really need to love the business and have a passion for it.A better way to become financially independent is to maximize your earnings while working for someone else, especially early on, and cut your expenses as much as possible. Save a ton and invest early.Typically you need about 25x your annual expenses, although I'd argue that's a bit low and would only allow you to just keep afloat. That also assumes you make no additional income ever after you "retire".Let's say you just hit 30, make $100k/year (gross), but your expenses are only $20k/year. You're not saving $80/year, but probably at least $70k once you factor in 401k matching. At that rate, you could rack up and save/invest for 10 years, then have all your living expenses covered, plus some. You might be able to take small vacations here and there. Working for 15-20 years and then calling it quits to pursue something else would most certainly grant you a lot more financial stability and the ability to have more freedom and spending cash later. Certainly beats working 40+ years like most people are going to have to do...&#x200B;Back to the point, no, you don't need to own your own business or come up with some new novel idea or product to become financial independent. It's more about living within your means and putting your money to work for you either in stocks and other financial instruments, or rental properties, etc. I must say, you do have to do at least one more 'passive' style income in conjunction with making at least a decent income at a regular 9-5 for some time however."

e4zgz2i;DawsonHelms;1535505590.0;"I can speak to this, as I've grown up in a family owned business. One thing that most people never consider when starting a business is retirement. Owning a small business means you have no retirement plan. You have no health insurance through a company. You have no benefits. You pay for everything, because at the end of the day, any extras the company pays for, has a direct impact on what you take home. Additionally, depending on the state, you may pay more in taxes. For instance, in Oklahoma, where I'm from, you pay income tax at 7.5% (I think), then you pay an additional 7.5% for self employment tax. It's definitely possible to start a company that is wildly successful and that you can sit back and collect the check, but the overwhelming majority of startups never get anywhere close. You'll put in a ton of time and money getting your first dollar. People always say that when you own your own business, you get to pick your hours and you can work half days. My dad always responses with " You absolutely can work half days. Either the first 12 hours or the second 12 hours." "
e4z069y;Vanderkaum037;1535490340.0;"There are plenty of ways to be your own boss that aren’t exactly entrepreneurship. You can be a cpa and start your own tax advisory, be a lawyer and start your own litigation practice, be an insurance agent and go IC, etc. Many successful business owners are just professionals or tradesmen who learn their skills on a very well-worn path before branching out on their own so to speak. There are highly compensated fields out there—medicine, etc. I won’t even get into people who retire from the military at age 39 with a full pension and start a second career."
e4z0rx8;aceman97;1535490979.0;"No. You can either be an entrepreneur or save a lot of money. I use my friend as an example. He is a welder and makes about 55k a year. He is 35. He is underpaid at the moment but saves almost 60% of his take home pay. He will retire in 3 years according to his projections and is currently financially independent. I think of him anytime someone says it’s impossible. "

e4z6ccb;swan797;1535496405.0;"I mean, there are a lot of people who are comfortably retired who were not engineers.

I know teachers and retired military who have stable pensions that let them pursue their dreams because they are financially independent.  I know blue collar immigrants who can barely speak English that started restaurants, nail salons, and other businesses who can retire with $2 million plus. I know many who have steadily and quietly acquired real estate investments and some of those folks are financially independent.  I know doctors and lawyers and entrepreneurs who are going bankrupt because they have no plan.  If you can successfully build a company you likely can also become financially independent, but you have to plan."

e4zgqm2;jppope;1535505384.0;"Entrepreneurship is often times a misnomer. For people that actually run their own companies, all you are really doing is diversifying the source of your income (and minor differences in taxation). And (generally) the further you get in your career the more ownership you have of the situation anyway (Company stock options, performance based compensation, etc)(opinion) So you're better off thinking of yourself as a business owner all the time and making your goal to get more money from more sources, so in the event that a source of income changes you will be impacted less.Reid Hoffman actually talks a bit about this in his book "The Startup of You" which is a pretty good read.

If you can reach that kind of independence, you can get them on a track that puts them to your point earlier in life.  If your kids do this, you grandkids can be even farther ahead.

You're really still completely dependent on your employer for your existence, and don't actually control half of your life.You have a business that consistently rakes in more than enough to comfortably cover everything? You've at least diversified your income so that no single person can take away your livelihood, and you're really just dependent on the system you've set up still working well with the market. You have some real freedom in terms of hiring people and delegating tasks you don't want to do, directly growing your income by growing your business, etc. You are still dependent on keeping that machine running though.You consistently have more capital gains and passive income than you want to spend? You are actually free. You can stop working at any moment and it won't affect your status at all. You don't want to do something? You don't even have to think about it. Bonus points if you have enough that you can live off the gains from really safe investments like UST bills, since then you aren't even really dependent on economic swings, just whether or not the US government is still standing.You can start transistioning into that last tier with about $2m in capital, even $1m if you live in a cheap area and are frugal.

Secondly you would actually have energy to keep up with them, which can be difficult when you are older. Additionally, for a lot of folk, peak career growth is when you are mid 30 to mid 40. Having newborns during that time will almost certainly negatively affect the mothers career, and possibly also the fathers career due to new priorities and drain on time. Older kids take away less time, attention and sleep than newborns and toddlers. There is also the obvious thing about getting pregnant and pregnancy itself being easier when the mother is in the 20s rather than late 30s.Obviously there are a lot of negatives and this decision is dependent on a lot of variables, but it isn’t all crazy to have kids a little earlier rather than later."

Collision insurance can also be dropped once the car is paid off, especially if the car has been very depreciated by the end of the loan.So between an established e-fund, paid off car, and cheaper insurance, that's around $1k per month that could be diverted to investments.

Just work towards this lifestyle actually being real.Don't misinterpret the goal of FIRE meaning me hating my job sure there are things like the commute and perhaps the lack of control at times I'd rather much do without but it's about giving yourself greater freedom of choice and greater security in life. There's a difference between needing a job and wanting a job. Those that need one make themselves vulnerable towards being pushed around as they will worry about where the next paycheck is going to come from. We often like to think of ourselves as less dispensable than we actually are in our workplaces too.It is entirely possible that I could end up getting bored of early retirement and go part time. This is something that wouldn't normally be sustainable without being FI to cover the bills. FIRE plays out very well for stages in peoples lives that perhaps aren't focused on careers like raising a family. If you're already FI spending a couple of years focusing on raising the kids wouldn't be a problem and moving out where there are bigger properties but perhaps not as many jobs would also be no problem. There are many other reasons for pursuing FIRE and financial independance doesn't necasarily mean retiring early it just gives you the option. To me having that freedom of choice is next level freedom.Edit: I also wanted to add that FIRE can be achieved quicker than most people realise mostly due to compounding and realising the S&P500 compound annual growth rate sits around 10%.

So, maybe we're selling a SaaS product, and we need buy-in and sign-off of the VP of Engineering and other dev leaders to ensure not only the sale but also adoption through the tech stack.  The sales director doesn't necessarily have the aptitude and credibility to speak the language of that crowd.

It might involve significant custom code in one or more languages on my part, or it may just be literally a guy who can talk shop and help them feel good about the pitch.

You are making it hard on yourself putting a silly requirement on relationships like that. 6 years ago I am super active on social media. Sharing travel vacations, good food and festivals. The younger me feels the need to be validated like that. Nowadays I am barely active after settling down and having a daughter. I feel like I want to be more private when it comes with my daughter and family."

e4zci00;CrabPeople123;1535501792.0;"Sales tax is a state tax to generate income that is only applied when buying things. Inheritance tax on the other hand is a federal tax and seeing as they also collected tax when I earned the money it seems like BS to me they can double dip just because I die. I disagree with the notion that giving my children my own already taxed money is a taxable transaction. "

e4yhg25;Throwawayacct449393;1535458094.0;"Never rely on analyst predictions, ever. I've looked into them for basically all the big companies and it almost seems like the analysts don't know jack about the stock in terms of future performance. It seems like most analysts will just take the current momentum (rising or falling) and then project that out 3 months with a 10% increase or decrease based on the momentum.Instead what you should do is look at their REASONING behind whatever their prediction is and then compare that to your prediction. Use it as a baseline guide but never 100% rely on the analyst recommendations."

9aqjmh;kingdomart;1535416990.0;What is your plan when a stock hits your evaluation before it becomes a long term gain?
9aqjmh;kingdomart;1535416990.0;"Let's say I wanted to buy AMD at $26, but I agree with the evaluation of X company that it will hit $30.    Let's say AMD hits my target of $30 before the stock becomes a long term gain.  Is it better to just sell then because it hit my target, or should I hold until it's a long term gain?I guess what I could do is add in the tax difference, so it wouldn't make a difference?  So, if AMD hitting $32 would cancel out the taxes of it being a short term gain compared to a long term gain.  Then I can sell as if I held it for a year.What do you generally do?"

e4xdvnx;OfficialHavik;1535419924.0;"Personally, I love buying, hate selling, so if it doesn't pay a dividend, I'm not likely to be a big fan in the first place.My favorite holding period is forever. "
e4xo7mc;jsf67;1535428830.0;"I think I'm better than the market at estimating the value (future price) of individual stocks.  But not **THAT** much better.    Selling for a taxable short term gain is a pretty strong bet that you are better than the market at predicting future price.  Per dollar that you might be right or wrong, the downside of being wrong is much larger than the upside of being right.    I have a big portfolio.  I usually find enough short term losses that I can take some short term gains without the serious tax hit.  Under those conditions you just need slightly better than random to justify acting on the feel that a stock went up too soon."
e4y8s32;nealosis;1535448540.0;"I could care less. As soon as a stock reaches my profit target, I sell. Iâ€™d rather pay higher taxes on profits than write off the loss because I wanted to avoid taxes "

e4xr7np;rayfound;1535431298.0;"Well, you could buy a PUT that expires past your tax-basis timeframe to protect yourself from downward movement. "
e4xc51f;nordinarylove;1535418411.0;"If it's in a non-taxable account I would sell, if it's in a taxable account I would raise my target sell price to account for taxes before I sell."
e4xbjyu;kingdomart;1535417898.0;"That's what I was thinking of doing, but doing it when it reaches the tax level difference. So, I would make the same amount as if I held it long."
e4xeq45;kingdomart;1535420655.0;"That's a good perspective.  I am just starting to diversify a bit more into divined paying stocks. "
e4xhayz;__Levi;1535422842.0;"What if it goes back down in that time though?  Honestly I'd be happy enough that I made a good profit in such a short time to worry too much about the taxes."

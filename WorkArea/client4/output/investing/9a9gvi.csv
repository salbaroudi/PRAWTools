9a9gvi;noodlesincup;1535254386.0;"I watched a few youtube videos but no one explained clearly whats a stop limit and what is the difference when compared to normal limit."

e4tuw7u;Salesman89;1535260151.0;"So...... (sees that nobody has even TRIED answering the question)..................A limit order is when you specify a target price for which your selected amount of shares will be traded.  Once that price is reached, the transaction is sent.  By the time all is done, the price may change slightly, but you will have a result very near your set limit price.A stop limit is when you select a price that, when the stock reaches that point, a limit order will go into effect.  You set the price that initiates when a limit order is made and what price that limit order will become a market sell.Limit orders help with buying and selling at targeted prices, clean and simple.  Wanna buy AMD when/if it drops to $20?  Limit order to buy X shares of AMD at $20/s.Stop limits protect your investments from a crash on that day or until you cancel the stop limit order.  Dont wanna be left with all your AMD as it drops back down?  Stop Limit at $22/s with a limit order of $21/s, you wont receive less than $21/s and the limit order only happens if the price drops to $22/s.Not much of a difference, but if you are away from actively trading for a week, you still have control with stop limits."

e4tqcyn;steveste1;1535255553.0;"Shouldnt take balls to ask a question. Reddit is a place to ask questions and discuss with others... which is what OP is doing. Your comment is more pointless than any post. "
e4tqjvc;eskjcSFW;1535255744.0;"lmao you can figure your out with a 2 second Google search and 60 seconds of reading instead of having to ask reddit which may or may not yield valid results."
e4ts0z0;hydrocyanide;1535257232.0;"Right because if you search something in google you're guaranteed to get better results for questions."
e4tsok5;eskjcSFW;1535257880.0;"for something trivial like this Google will never let you down"

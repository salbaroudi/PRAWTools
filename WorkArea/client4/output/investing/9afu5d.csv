9afu5d;kmahhhhgaa;1535321879.0;"What’s everyone’s thoughts on these? Looking for a way to hedge my portfolio without taking the risk of directly shorting a security. Was thinking a inverse high yield fund, but not sure how reliable this would be over a loner period "

e4v2v9j;kiwimancy;1535322051.0;"What risk exposures are you looking to isolate? Why not just own less stocks?"
e4vkpb5;janto98;1535340032.0;"Buy long term puts on those sectors"
e4v89v8;rjm101;1535327878.0;"I wouldn't recommend them, they decay over time. Just reduce your exposure for whatever is concerning you or just have cash ready to buy the dip if you're confident about the long-term."
e4vbi2n;motterpaul;1535331079.0;"Be very careful of any leveraged ETF (2x or 3x) - the losses are always much bigger than the gains - do not get invested in these funds and stay in them.You can find plenty of non-leveraged inverse funds, though."
e4vfk2z;Arithm88;1535335037.0;"Consider shorting the inverse etf or buying puts on it"
e4vqm47;_IN_THE_YEAR_2000_;1535345682.0;"Don't do this.  There are much better ways to hedge, but given you asked about inverse ETFs on reddit, those ways aren't for you either.[Fancy Play Syndrome](http://poker.wikia.com/wiki/Fancy_play_syndrome)"
e4w0jvz;big_deal;1535356080.0;"Shorting market beta just offsets the market beta you own. This can sometimes make sense if you are trying to isolate a specific risk exposure (e.g. idiosyncratic, sector, factor). If all you want is lower market exposure it would be cheaper to just sell to reduce your allocation to equities. If you really just want crash protection on equities that you intend to continue to hold, a 1x inverse fund seems like a poor approach. "
e4v47lb;kmahhhhgaa;1535323578.0;"Already am about 20% in ust’s. Not trying to time the market but would like a substantial short position in some sectors that look overvalued and would offer a hedge on my equities "
e4w1l5k;kmahhhhgaa;1535357224.0;"Would they be for a buy side trader at a hedge fund? "
e4v6m3d;kiwimancy;1535326188.0;"Inverse sector funds can work but they will have some significant daily compounding losses. That worsens with the volatility of the underlying, so I think individual sectors will be affected more than an inverse broad market fund. But the chart doesn't look too bad. https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?SPY,sef,xlf,sh  You can also buy puts on sector funds as an alternative."

9a3ozf;FCPharmacy;1535195109.0;"Not sure this is the right group to be posting this in but if I wanted to start a 401k plan for my small business and my employees how would I go into doing that?"

e4sn81x;kiwimancy;1535200800.0;"https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/small-business/401k-plans  https://institutional.vanguard.com/web/c1/solutions/dcretirementplan/focus  https://www.merrilledge.com/small-business/401k  Merrill's page has more information and you can do the initial request/customization without giving your real info. I think vanguard and fidelity are likely better though. Request a plan outline from a few providers and choose the best/cheapest one."

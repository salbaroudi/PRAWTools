9a1vec;MindFuktd;1535178776.0;I sold AMD 'on-the-close' today for a +30% profit. Am I a fool for not holding on for more gains?
9a1vec;MindFuktd;1535178776.0;"AMD has been rocketing this week. Saw the opportunity to cash out some gains, which I will probably invest in AAPL if it produces a good entry, and just hold for long term.I love being apart of a massive run-up, but also don't like being left with the bag after the party's over (has happened before).  Any wise, sage advice out there for me on Reddit?"

e4s47sv;Gob_Bluth_Illusions;1535179576.0;"No.  Never kick yourself for taking profit, especially with a stock like AMD.  If it triples over the next year, will you feel a little foolish?  Maybe.If news comes out next week that the books were cooked and the stock tanks will you feel like a genius?  Absolutely."
e4s6t7z;tree-farmer;1535182232.0;"Nobody went broke taking profits"
e4s697c;1stBaronKelvin;1535181649.0;"I wouldn't sell the whole position if you still believe in the company.That's how you miss out in the big ones. "
e4s97cn;mattyfresh22;1535184762.0;"30% is a nice gain don’t beat yourself up. I’m kicking myself for selling at $12 for a 100% gain but profits beat losses any day. "
e4s7lbg;Wetrapordie;1535183059.0;"Mate you made a profit that’s all that matters. Don’t get hung up on timing the market or holding out. 30% is a good profit for any investment. If you could compound 30% results year on year you would retire a very wealthy person "
e4sdz9r;leaveit2;1535189823.0;"You'll never go poor when selling for a profit "
e4shbrq;caine269;1535193514.0;"i am kicking myself for selling half my appl holdings in may. and selling microsoft for a 20% profit in 2014. and laughing at the "suckers" who bought facebook at the ipo price of $44(or whatever). you will always have "if only i just held longer..." or "if only i had sold last week." my father usually puts his sells in once he gets 10% and he is doing fine. don't get greedy, but if you get to a target amount, then put in a stop loss, you can't loose."
e4s41y2;komokat4;1535179412.0;"I would only sell if the underlying reasons as to why I bought the stock changed. If it's a company you believe and and have researched it should be profitable over the long term. Selling and trying to "get back in" at dips is difficult. Time is very valuable."
e4s4x6s;zephyy;1535180289.0;"if you're up and worried about missing out, sell 80% of your gains and leave the rest in"
e4slgh2;oberlre02;1535198428.0;"Sell AMD, buy NVDA. The runup for it has not started yet and will be as epic as AMD. AMD gonna retract next week. "
e4vjmqp;spankasmurf;1535339016.0;"buy low,sell high - you win the game.  something something Pigs get slaughtered"
e4s4ie3;ggfdwqqduutiokbdew;1535179870.0;"i was considering doing that. i bough two shares and nearly made 12$ just from that. it’s so sick"
e4sicbo;ScottishTrader;1535194692.0;"I closed an AMD position today as well.  Never lament what could have been, be happy for your profit."
e4s5axn;bannercoin;1535180674.0;"If you plan to invest in Apple, then you're golden. AMD can run to $50 Billion market cap, then it's sideways or downhill from there. That's a double. Apple can get to $2 to $5 Trillion (2 to 5x) and pays a nice dividend while you wait. "
e4s9udh;MindFuktd;1535185422.0;"Right! I like grabbing cash from the market - it makes me feel good."
e4saafz;MindFuktd;1535185883.0;"My man!"
e4saa2b;MindFuktd;1535185872.0;"Maybe some wisdom here.. I thought about selling half.But this kind of price movement usually sees a sudden correction back down to deal price levels."
e4sp1ox;AlNOKEA;1535203550.0;"This guy knows."
e4sadan;MindFuktd;1535185967.0;"Right on. I bought earlier this year just sub $11 and sold that in about two weeks for +25%. If only I had just held..."
e4saaxh;MindFuktd;1535185898.0;"That is the plan!"
e4t93os;MindFuktd;1535238325.0;"Interesting advice! Actually haven't ever used a stop loss. Do you use stops for short term trades as well as long holds?I'd be worried about being crushed by a gap down ..."
e4sa0rn;MindFuktd;1535185605.0;"Haven't researched the company at all. My reason for buying was to make money off the price action. Only thing is judging by the daily trend and closing at the top of a green candle, it seems everybody else is buying while I'm selling! Hope I don't leave too much on the table.."
e4sa6r8;MindFuktd;1535185776.0;"Ehh, any further gains on the remaining 20% would be chump change, my position wasn't Donald-Trump Huuuge"
e4t95uk;MindFuktd;1535238390.0;"Already in NVDA balls deep! Do you plan to sell or hold long? I know a lot of people have made a lot trading NVDA!"
e4sa3as;MindFuktd;1535185678.0;"Damn bro, you're $12 richer! Enough for a happy meal and a bottle of lube.."
e4siqtc;Pushazg;1535195165.0;"Which one is more likely at this stage? Also, why limit AMD to only 50B? Seems pretty silly that you’ve convinced yourself that AMD is not doing as well as it is right now."
e4saifw;MindFuktd;1535186114.0;"Yeah, great point. My better judgement has the larger portion of my portfolio in long-term names like Google and Microsoft that I just strictly add to. I'll swing a quick profit if I can on names like AMD."
e4tigz4;caine269;1535247690.0;"i don't use them nearly as much as i should, but if i have a stock that has earned me 20% or something, i will put a stop loss a few percent below the typical daily trading level. if it triggers, i make my money. if not, it keeps going up. i have never had a gap down issue. i usually use them more on the short term stocks. i do not have one on appl now, since i don't see much likelihood of dropping significantly any time soon.the number of times i have bought a stock (like lrcx) and it gained 20-30% short term, and i did nothing, and it slid back down to even/loss is sickening."
e4sb656;ggfdwqqduutiokbdew;1535186792.0;"ya dude!!"
e4tn50d;HunterRountree;1535252262.0;"Maybe just a bottle of lube. Shits pricey"
e4t5vlf;bannercoin;1535234842.0;"AMD is doing really well at the moment. Never said it wasn't. I think it will double it's market cap over the next couple of years. That's pretty strong growth. However, it may start to fade back to irrelevance if Intel gets its act together and recaptures lost server market share. Past a couple of years, I don't see what else will be a driver of growth. AMD has had moments of greatness in years past, but always seems to find a way to ruin it, given enough time. "

99wj2u;amy31415;1535138097.0;""... new customers had to deposit a minimum of $10,000 to open an account, which was one of the highest minimums in the industry for retail investors and traders. ...You can now open a cash account at IB with $0, or a margin account with $2,000, the regulatory minimum that all brokers must require. Executive Vice President Steve Sanders says, “We haven’t enforced the minimum for the last five years, to be honest.” ..."https://www.investopedia.com/news/interactive-brokers-eliminates-10000-account-minimum/"

e4ro368;longfield1;1535164865.0;"Have had an account opened for 6 months with them and funded it with only 2500$. All because I called them and they said your account would be approved before you funded it so basically the silent nod that 10k wasn’t required."

e4re1v0;forevercountingbeans;1535156479.0;"I'm not a risk-fiend by any means. But as a 25 year-old what is the downside to putting $2k in (reasonable amount that I wouldn't care to lose), investing the principle + margin and letting it ride for 10+ years?The interest spread would be about 4% annually on average for those 10 years and at worst I would lose a portion of my $2k.I'm just using the S&P index for my example. I don't think I would be able to speculate on margin because of how stressed it would make me."

e4sjf8i;bmwkbiker;1535195955.0;"The whole premise of this post is flawed! I'll assert that anybody that has 10k, 20k or even 50k to commit to a brokerage account they will be better served elsewhere (Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, TD, Merill Edge, +more). Unless you are crossing the 100k threshold or want to trade >20 times a month IB just isn't going to provide any value to to you. If you think you are ready to "day trade" then perhaps IB makes sense, but day trading on less than 100k is (for most) a snipe hunting adventure."

e4qz4bt;EasyE0287;1535142344.0;"While IB does have a lot of "little fees," like the $10 min. per month or the $4.50 for live quotes per month, these payments are net of commissions. Commissions at IB are dirt cheap, often just a few cents for an order if you use the tiered scale, whereas similar orders are $4-$7 at other brokers, and whatever you spend on commissions in a month gets deducted from your base $10. This would pay for itself after just 3 trades in a month versus other low cost brokerages---which I do just during my standard monthly contribution. Margin rates at IB are also among the industry lowest, which enables traders to finance their "riskier" trades at a much lower level."
e4qzrm8;Busch_League2;1535143137.0;"If you trade more than 4-5 times a month IB will come out cheaper than every other broker except for Robinhood."

e4r300d;bmwkbiker;1535146743.0;"They will be happy to open the account, but the fee structure doesn't make any sense for "small" investors.Anybody who doesn't have 10K to fund an account with them should be looking elsewhere."

e4rmacg;bmwkbiker;1535163323.0;"Downside is "sequence of return risk". If you don't margin then over any 10 year period the SP500 is likely to pay off well (or at least not be down). If you margin up, and aren't willing/able to commit additional funds to cover a margin call you may be forced to sell when the next downdraft occurs."
e4v210r;Nettletooth;1535321032.0;"Disagree.  Buying or selling options on a small account is brutal with normal fees.Ok, you want to do a cash covered put that will net you .35 cents.  You have enough money for 100 shares, so you just sell your 1 put, except now your broker is taking 8 of the 35 dollars you would net.I hope you never wanted to buy that short option back, because that will cost you 8 dollars to buy back that option that is now worth 5 bucks.Or, lets say you are have been bagholding F for the last 3 years.  You are done with F, and want to do a covered call since you would be happy to let it go for 10 a share.You sell your 3 F calls, net 90 dollars, - 8 or so from your average broker.If you were with IB, the most you would pay is .70 cents a contract.  These fees really add up.Although they do nickel and dime you for everything data feed wise, I find for the trading I do, I don't need real time stock prices or anything like that.  I just log on to fidelity and get current option prices and stock prices, and use limit orders.  "
e4rzvqd;hedgefundaspirations;1535175292.0;"If that's all your doing it's trash. The most important things for an account like that are no fee mutual funds and ETFs, a good ui, and great customer service. IB is last place of any broker in the latter two categories. Just get Fidelity or Vanguard for buy and hold index funds."
e4rzg03;dirtee_1;1535174885.0;"The mind likes simplicity. Besides I have no problems trading options and placing things like stop losses and limit orders on other platforms. I don’t need unnecessary complexity in my life in order to feel smart."

e4s2ggk;anonyymi;1535177804.0;"Yeah, they had some weird requirement like you had to show a credit card or utility bill that's on a paper to confirm your address.

e4rq9ak;that1celebrity;1535166736.0;"I used IB's stock yield enhancement program (shares lending program). The risk is that you are giving short sellers more liquidity to short the companies you are long in. As a retail investor, it's not much concern and you'll only be making a few dollars a month.  As a fund with $30M+, it's something you should be concerned about as you don't want to make it easy for other funds to short your positions."

e4rixsr;anonyymi;1535160534.0;"> **How is the income received by a customer on any given Stock Yield Enhancement Program loan transaction determined?**>The income which a customer receives in exchange for shares lent depend upon loan rates established in the over-the-counter securities lending market. These rates can vary significantly not only by the particular security loaned but also by the loan date. In general, IB pays interest to participants on their cash collateral at a rate that approximates 50% of the amounts earned by IB for lending the shares. . For example, assume IB earns 15% annualized income from lending shares with a value of $10,000 and it posts $10,000 cash collateral to a participant’s account. The normal daily interest rate IB would pay to a participant on the cash collateral would be $2.08https://ibkr.info/node/1838/"

If you are trading something popular with millennials like SNAP that's like 1% a year. By your logic people should always just use market orders since the spread is almost always "a negligible amount," yet MMs rake in billions.

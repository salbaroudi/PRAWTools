9a0hrj;skullassfreak;1535168371.0;"Hey Im looking for a comparison of these 3 since they have no fees.  Which have you used with success?"

e4rsdn9;PutsOnINT;1535168580.0;"M1 finance is really good from my experience. You have to be careful with the others maybe. While the service itself might be free, the underlying etfs may have bad ERs or might force you to keep a cash position."
e4rujxl;OpeningComedian;1535170470.0;"I’m pretty happy with Schwab. They offer a lot of stuff for free. I haven’t seen any hidden fees and they haven’t had me really micromanage anything so far."
e4se4yr;Walden_Walkabout;1535190000.0;"I love schwab as my main brokerage. I threw 10K into a robo advisor portfolio about 2 months ago, so it is a little soon to say whether it holds up or not. Overall though, I'm fine with the holdings and love the idea of rebalancing without having to put in any thought.I will say this, I disagree with the other people about it keeping cash on hand in the account. I have <10% cash in the account with my risk tolerance level at 75%(?), and keeping some cash on hand is good for an account where you are supposed to be able to rebalance over time."
e4ry7da;McKoijion;1535173746.0;"Be careful. Many of these no-fee roboadvisors make money by keeping a substantial portion of your account in cash, and then lending it out like a normal bank would (while paying you minimal interest). Nothing in life is free."
e4s7r6o;Eggs_is_eggs;1535183228.0;"I would DIY at a real broker."
e4rshoe;skullassfreak;1535168674.0;"Is there a way to just set it and forget it or do you constantly have to rebalance?"
e4s0npm;PBandJames;1535176046.0;"I like Schwab, but I closed my IP account because* I didn’t like that much cash sitting around doing nothing* Their own MarketTrack portfolio funds have lower fees than the ETFs IP uses"
e4sarbk;abdulis2cool;1535186370.0;"You haven't heard of M1 then"
e4scesf;WhisperingOak22;1535188132.0;"Not the case with M1"
e4ryvgb;skullassfreak;1535174357.0;"Yeah I figured it was something like that. That's basically what is happening in my bank. Thanks for the tip. How does that compare to management fees?"
e4ruf23;abdulis2cool;1535170352.0;"You don't really need to rebalance more than once a year. M1 has once click rebalancing but you have to initiate it manually.Also, schwab intelligent portfolio has a huge cash drag so it isn't *really* free. And Wisebanyan has a limited set of portfolios unlike the freedom of M1."
e4scdt3;WhisperingOak22;1535188102.0;"abdulis2cool is mostly right but it’s also important to note that you don’t need to hit the manual rebalance on M1. You set a portfolio pie with percentages for different slices. Say you have AMZN at 50% and AAPL at 50%, but amazon outperforms. Your next deposit will go towards apple until it is balanced at the percentages you allocated. So there is automatic rebalancing and you can set and forget"

e4rztnr;McKoijion;1535175239.0;"It depends on what you think is going to happen to the stock market.* With Schwab, 6-30% of your account is parked as cash* With other roboadvisors, 0.25-0.5% of the account is charged as a feeIf you think the stock market is going up, then the "cash drag" of keeping cash in a rising stock market is going to greatly hurt your overall gains. If you think that the stock market is going down, then keeping it as cash is going to help (but less than if you kept it as bonds).Personally, I think it's far better to just pick a simple portfolio (1 US total market, 1 foreign total market, and 1 bond fund with a predetermined asset allocation) and just take a few minutes every month or so to invest the money yourself. The only way that the roboadvisor is better is if you don't trust yourself to invest regularly or if you think you might change your approach based on market conditions. It's better to invest with slightly higher fees than to not invest at all."
e4u64dr;abdulis2cool;1535272091.0;"Okay? Every brokerage does that.Are you trying to point something out? The user pays no cost/fees"
e4sln7o;WhisperingOak22;1535198668.0;"OP can do your approach on M1 getting charged 0.0% and have no cash balance being lent out as you falsely claimed earlier. "

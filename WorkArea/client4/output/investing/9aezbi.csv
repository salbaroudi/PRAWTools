9aezbi;Newacountero;1535312943.0;VGT (IT) vs QQQ (Tech)
9aezbi;Newacountero;1535312943.0;"Hi,what would be the better choice over the long term (20-30 years) - pure IT etf like the $VGT or broader tech like the $QQQ and why?I am from the EU, so we dont have the same ETFs, but we have some iShares equivalents which track the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector and NASDAQ-100 index. The expense ratio is lower (0,15%) for the IT index ETF compared to the one tracking nasdaq-100 (0,33%).I do have some "VGT equivalent" ETFs right now, but I dont like the fact, that it lacks companies like Amazon, Netflix etc. so I am leaning to switching over to the NASDAQ-100 ETF.Your thoughts?"

e4v3r19;Boosted_C5;1535323063.0;"I don't use QQQ because I've already got more than enough exposure to the stocks at the top of it just via having an S&P fund in our portfolio through a 403(b) with mostly crummy options but at least a relatively low cost S&P index fund.  QQQ is basically FAANG the ETF now.  "FAANG" is nearly 40% of it.  Add in Microsoft and you're at 50%.&#x200B;It's a great ETF though, just doesn't fit my style since I do not like any one company to make up more than \~2% of our portfolio.&#x200B;I do use VGT which has a HUGE Apple position (and Apple is our largest individual position b/c of it) for a small slice.  I like that it includes Visa and Mastercard.&#x200B;I also use ARKW which someone else has already mentioned.  It has the FAANG stocks and other speculative tech and tech-ish stocks, but non as severely overweighted as in QQQ. &#x200B;At the end of the day, these are ALL good funds.  I don't use FDN or QQQ but they're every bit as good as the ones I do use.  Nothing preventing you from using a combination of multiple of them if you want.  I have our portfolio set up such that my favorite tech stocks (Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Google, and Microsoft) are all hovering right around my  \~2% max for any individual company.&#x200B;I have also found it useful to set up a portfolio spreadsheet with all of our fund holdings across IRAs, taxable, & 403(b).  Dollar amount in each across the top, below that % of portfolio calculated based on that, and going down the first column every individual stock listed and it's weight in every subsequent column in the corresponding ETF.&#x200B;And FYI, over the past decade, FDN, QQQ, and VGT are all in the Top 20 non-leveraged ETfs for rate of return.  ARKW hasn't been around that long but it's outperformed them since inception in 2014."

e4vgxdg;DifferentJackfruit;1535336388.0;"Keep in mind TQQQ is a 3x leveraged ETF. This is not a good choice for a buy-and-hold investor. "
e4uxqjw;WilliamNyeTho;1535314940.0;"Check out ARKW while you're at it.Pretty much you can make a portfolio as tech-heavy as you want - just be prepared for the increased beta making your portfolio value swing a bit more than a straight spx buy and hold"

e4winwf;DifferentJackfruit;1535377901.0;"I guess it has been doing well for now since the market is on it's longest bull run. Your losses will be triple-fold when the market goes down or trades sideways. Plus, the trading gets reset daily so honestly it's not designed for holding more than a day at the maximum ([https://www.thebalance.com/leveraged-etfs-lose-money-357489](https://www.thebalance.com/leveraged-etfs-lose-money-357489))"

9a9b4n;dgkaufman;1535253157.0;"Is anyone using MarketSmith, thoughts?"

e4trnjh;Brodman_area11;1535256854.0;"It’s legit and helpful, but spendy.  I figure I’d need to have about 50k in “playable” investments for it to be worth the cost, and you’d have to be in agreement with their CAN SLIM model plus technical analyses."
e4v1oo9;RTiger;1535320599.0;"An excellent tool. I attend a monthly IBD meetup and most of the heavy hitters love MarketSmith.Need to mostly follow the CANSLIM method, have a large portfolio, have a keen interest in the markets for it to be worth it. For large I'd go higher than the first response, six figures minimum to make the cost worthwhile. Even then there are so many free tools on many platforms, a person can get by without it."

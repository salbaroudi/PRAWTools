9b0o44;Darius510;1535504472.0;"I know the sub's stance on Bitcoin is generally negative (to put it lightly.) Whether you're for or against it, we can at least all agree that at it's current stage, it's an extremely high risk investment, or rather that the risk is virtually unquantifiable at this point.In either case, even if one never "understood" the value of Bitcoin, arguably most average joe investors in traditional markets don't understand the value of their investments either, they're just following the advice of their financial advisors or following the wisdom of the crowd. As they should in situations where they are not experts. So what do you think it would take for either yourself or the mainstream opinion of experts and/or the general public to shift? What metrics or turning points would you be looking at to determine whether it's reached a point of legitimacy? Even if you held a very strong belief that Bitcoin is eventually going to zero, what would you need to see before you would start to question that belief?For an extreme example, if in 2080 we find that 98% of the world used Bitcoin for 98% of their transactions and 98% of their store of value for the last 100 years, and there were thousands of financial institutions and products built around it, it would obviously be well beyond the point where it was legitimate. Anyone who didn't think so at that point would be part of the lunatic fringe, as arguably most Bitcoiners are now. To be clear I'm not predicting that, I'm just saying no matter how against it you may be now, there has to be a line where being against it could no longer be a serious position. Where do you think that line is?"

e4zhezf;dvdmovie1;1535505969.0;""I know the sub's stance on Bitcoin is generally negative"I'm not negative to Bitcoin (mixed at best and have gone over my views on it on here previously at length.) I'm negative to people who sell it like it's a religion and they're trying to get you to take a pamphlet to learn about how their Bitcoin religion is the greatest thing to happen to humanity. I think it's kind of fascinating that this sub is viewed as "hating bitcoin" and there rarely seems to be the realization that perhaps much of this sub probably couldn't care either way about Bitcoin but doesn't like hearing again and again about how it's the best thing to ever happen to mankind.This is most of the people who post about Bitcoin and I think this is a part of the reason why this sub doesn't like it. If you're going to preach about it, there's r/bitcoin. "
e4zgis0;Demandredz;1535505193.0;"Bitcoin, like gold, magic the gathering cards, stamps, is not really something a traditional investor is going to be typically interested in.  It has no earnings, it can't grow, all you can do is hope that someone in the future will pay more for it than you did based on no real fundamentals.  It can go up a lot (just like the price of a black lotus), but its not really a traditional investment of any kind and nothing can really change that anymore than with those other assets."
e4zge38;manofthewild07;1535505076.0;"Bitcoin or blockchain currencies in general?"
e4ziovj;dying_to_be_vain;1535507042.0;"I consider myself a fairly "conservative" investor - I like profitable companies at reasonable prices, and for the longest time, I sat out the Bitcoin mania.  I am most definitely not a crypto evangelist.  That said, I do own some Bitcoin, and what interested me isn't its riskiness, but rather its volatility.  I mean, everyone from institutional investors to mom & pop investors have been lamenting for years - especially in recent years - how correlated all the major asset classes are.  Then along comes Bitcoin with decent liquidity and wildly uncorrelated volatility...and nothing. So, for me, I have a small amount of Bitcoin, and an equal amount of BND (really, any low- or no-cost bond fund will do), and I rebalance between the two regularly.  Worst case scenario, Bitcoin goes to $0, and I'm left with half my invested money.  Best case scenario, we get a few more pump-and-dump schemes here, and I'm able to rebalance back and forth, sell-high, buy-low.  Most likely scenario - somewhere in between, but at least I had some fun and didn't lose my shirt.There's a lot of HODLers out there, and for every HODLer there's probably ten "never buy Bitcoin ever" investors, but I hear almost no one taking a more modest, asset allocation type approach, and I personally always wonder why.Also, while I'm not sure of the value of Bitcoin, and I certainly don't think it has a positive expected return, I also think it's absurd to think its valueless.  The stories of regular people in countries with intense currency problems (Venezuela, various countries in Africa, Turkey being the latest) proves that Bitcoin has real world value to these people.  And there's some highly concentrated holdings with people who are motivated to keep the Bitcoin train rolling.  I think bank-toppling, widespread adoption in the US is unlikely, but again - Crypto doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing thing.  There's plenty of value for it to occupy the a middle ground of "provides some value, and supplements the current system."In the meantime, I plan to continue harvesting the volatility of Bitcoin, and let this thing play out."

Incidentally, there's been some more articles about how BTC/crypto should be a part of every young investor's ptf (small, like 3%) because of the reward/cost tradeoffs to a young investor. "

They're famous and they make a lot of profit. It's incredibly simple to understand even if the exact details of indexing, fund fee structures, etc aren't. I'm willing to bet that most investors understand that they're holding portions of companies that make money.Bitcoin's "value" -- and yes, it's in quotation marks because right now there is effectively no real value -- is based on a prediction of eventual widespread adoption based on the merits of its underlying technology and philosophy.

Someone else will create a different one as shown by the 1600 or so different currencies.If Bitcoin or some such is ever to be taken seriously, the following 3 things must happen:1) Must be accepted and adopted by countries and companies2) Must have a regulatory framework with a centralized governing body (I know goes against the whole concept)3) A process by which people would be compensated to switch their money into it.

I really don't intend for this to be a debate on semantics though. What I really mean to say is that even if the status quo doesn't see gold as an investment that appreciates in value, it's certainly not written off as worthless and is still taken seriously as a store of value and/or a hedge against currency inflation, which is also a speculative investment in it's own way."

Market leaders do get replaced every now and then. That's just markets at play.

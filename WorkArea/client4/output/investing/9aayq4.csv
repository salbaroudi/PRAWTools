9aayq4;Throwawayacct449393;1535266770.0;"So I've made a decent amount of money from the current bull run but I've realized that my portfolio is on the more "aggressive" side so to speak. I'm going to start taking my profits off the table and move some of the money into bonds. What ETFs/funds would you recommend? I'm not interested in return for these funds, just to make sure the capital is preserved.Thanks"

e4u4jlm;SirGlass;1535270344.0;"Bond funds, also there are some preferred stock ETF or utility sector ETF."
e4u43ba;mindfullyinvesting;1535269845.0;"Bond funds can lose money too.  Particularly when interest rates are going up.  For example, year-to-date BND is down -2.2%.  And bonds don't always go up when stocks go down, although they often have in the last 10 to 20 years.  As someone else said, if you don't care about returns, why not a high interest savings account or a CD?Also, timing the market is a losers game.  You may think the bull is about to end, but who knows for sure."
e4u49nj;underweightbull;1535270039.0;"I like dividends. So VIG, DVY, SDY, SCHD. Maybe look at treasury bond ETF's such as TLT, IEF, SHY which are 20+ year,7-10 year,and  1-3 year respectively. Treasury bonds have the lowest risk/reward when comparing investment methods."
e4u5wxa;rdw1982;1535271869.0;"Are you closing in on retirement or going to otherwise need the funds soon? If not, you're better off just keeping your portfolio as is.  The bull market could continue for another 1, 2, or 5 years etc... and you're going to lose out on any gains."
e4u3rlm;shobel87;1535269496.0;"if you don't care about the return and just want to preserve capital, why not a savings account?"
e4urbru;red_five_standingby;1535300803.0;"I was thinking about doing the same except just move everything in to a money market fund.  If i had only done that during the 2008 crash, i would be sitting very pretty."
e4u1zu2;neocoff;1535267568.0;"Could share what were your "aggressive" investments? Also, are you worried about the potential downturn? Is this why for the "safe" investments?"
e4u5gt4;ron_leflore;1535271375.0;"SHY or ITE.  You want short term US Treasuries."
e4uef4n;Gutierrezjm6;1535280970.0;"This is pretty good advice."
e4u7bp7;kiwimancy;1535273324.0;"-.95% with distributions"
e4u9792;Throwawayacct449393;1535275304.0;"Thank you. I am going for the treasuries."
e4u95n6;Throwawayacct449393;1535275256.0;"Thank you. I will go with the treasuries."
e4u92do;Throwawayacct449393;1535275158.0;"Not close to retirement but would rather have a more conservative portfolio."
e4u3zrs;Throwawayacct449393;1535269738.0;"I don't want to take the money out of the account is why."
e4u92zm;Throwawayacct449393;1535275176.0;"thanks"
e4ulg75;mindfullyinvesting;1535289755.0;"And why is -0.95% better than my savings account which pays 1.75% annually, or +0.875% for the first half of this year?  Bonds are a bad investment right now.  Bonds are not always "safe", despite what you read in many places."
e4umi3a;dbanderson1;1535291414.0;"You can typically hold cash or do a money market fund ."
e4uqegb;genericscotch;1535298775.0;">Bonds are not always "safe", despite what you read in many places.Bond funds in particular.  Government bonds themselves, held to maturity, are as safe as it gets."
e4vn7cj;bmwkbiker;1535342411.0;"The sweep money funds attached to most brokerage accounts are usually pretty lame in terms of yield. Sometimes you can do better buy self managing the sweep with a selected MM fund that trades like a mutual.For the most part I spread my free cash around by buying chunks of T-bills."
e4v3kul;mindfullyinvesting;1535322872.0;"I partially agree, but he was asking about bond funds not bonds."
e4v3sya;xcsler_returns;1535323121.0;"Except in inflationary environments."
e4v6bob;genericscotch;1535325885.0;"Yeah, just making the distinction."
e4v60cx;genericscotch;1535325552.0;"Can you explain?  Holding cash wouldn't be better since it would be affected by inflation as well."
e4vbd2k;xcsler_returns;1535330945.0;"I didn't say cash would be better and agree that it would be affected by inflation. All I'm saying is that if one suspects inflationary pressures in the future then bond funds wouldn't be the safe bet that they are perceived to be. Stocks and real estate would be a safer bet."
e4vfi2t;genericscotch;1535334983.0;"Oh I see what you mean, yeah I agree equities are better, but what I meant was that bonds held to maturity is the same as holding cash (minus the liquidity) in terms of protecting your principal regardless of changes in interest rates/inflation and such, whereas a bond fund doesn't guarantee your principal."
e4vjny2;xcsler_returns;1535339049.0;"Fair enough, but shouldn't we focus on preserving purchasing power over time as opposed to principal?"
e4vl5ub;genericscotch;1535340466.0;"Definitely.  I believe OP is looking to preserve the actual cash though, that's how I interpreted it at least."

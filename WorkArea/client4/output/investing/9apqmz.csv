9apqmz;wirsteve;1535411480.0;Chart of the S&P 500 without FAANG?
9apqmz;wirsteve;1535411480.0;"Does one exist? Is there a site where I can manipulate the data myself to see?I read that the FAANG stocks have done so well over the last couple years that they are actually more or less carrying the S&P 500. I'd like to see what the chart looks like myself to see if it is true.Interesting article but its from March and a lot has changed: https://exponentialetfs.com/how-to-de-faang/"

e4xbvoz;_rofl-copter_;1535418182.0;"Not exactly what you're looking for but here's the S&P ex-Technology compared to the S&P. Performance has trailed the S&P by about 30% of gains but has still been very good the past couple years.1-Year: https://imgur.com/u5MEdpk.png3-Years: https://imgur.com/MSSBdz5"
e4x7pe6;ToastedMayonnaise;1535414533.0;"I understand the concern you might have about tech being overvalued, but taking out 4/5 of the most valuable companies in the world is clearly going to impact the performance of an index metric that tracks companies with the largest market caps.It's basically asking, "If you take out the highest performers, how does that impact overall performance?" Answer: it will make performance look worse. The real question should be whether you think the performance of FAANG is sustainable or properly valued, which means digging into fundamentals and forecasting performance."
e4x5383;MorgUK;1535412197.0;"Would like to see this too. "
e4x931h;rebelde_sin_causa;1535415760.0;"Most of my portfolio is made up of SP500 companies, I don't own a FAANG, and I'm beating the SP500 the last two years. So anecdotally I am thinking the index isn't as FAANG dependent as a lot of folks seem to think it is."
e4xackb;dodo_gogo;1535416863.0;"So instead of a 25 pe it would be at 22.5 pe is what the article is saying?Was hoping itd be like 18 lol"
e4x5e5h;someroastedbeef;1535412466.0;"they very much areyou probably have to calculate it yourself and it'll be an approximation because of rebalancing. good place to start is the most recent holdings in SPY through an etf website that has that data"

e4x7g3n;jerschneid;1535414302.0;"I can't think of an easy way to look at the S&P 495, but you could certainly look at other US Stock indexes that don't include FAANG.Something like VIOO which tracks the S&P Small Cap 600 jumps to mind. [Here's a look](https://imgur.com/f40023f2-801c-46e8-9317-76abf0f5d239) at how the S&P 500 compared to the small cap 600. Nearly identical with small cap outperforming a bit. I think you would find that the S&P 500 with and without FAANG look almost identical."
e4x97mo;daviddavidson29;1535415871.0;"Compare a small cap fund to the S&P as a whole, and look at the difference. "
e4yphg5;Un-Scammable;1535471799.0;"I wanted to read this post but it was posted without Reddit. I couldn't find it in an alternate universe. I couldn't find the S&P without FAANG in the real universe. "
e4xe1my;doodle77;1535420068.0;"Amazon is classified as “retail” rather than “technology”."
e4xhnbb;mrpickles;1535423132.0;"> taking out 4/5 of the most valuable companies in the world is clearly going to impact the performance of an index metricDuh.  That's why such analysis would be interesting and useful. "
e4x95hq;wirsteve;1535415818.0;"Well 5 companies in the same sector make up ~15% of the S&P 500.It's clearly going to impact it, but if the market is doing as great as everybody says, then it should still be positive. What I've heard & read is that if you take out those 5 performers that the market is in the red. That's a little concerning.I just want to see if those 5 are skewing the data and making it look like we are on a better bull run then we really are. Technically to do that I'd need to drop 5 small under-performers too. But at this point I just want to see some data."
e4xxthz;farmallnoobies;1535437265.0;"Me too"
e4xbax5;schrodingerspup;1535417684.0;"True but it could be that you've weighted your portfolio in such a way that outperforms while it's still true that faang carries the market"
e4x5c0n;wirsteve;1535412414.0;"I don't know what that is...but I checked the holdings on Morningstar:4.15% of that is Amazon.85% of it is Netflix"
e4x84jr;bear_beer_beard;1535414913.0;"Except SPY and VIOO have hardly any overlap.  SPY is large-cap.  &#x200B;I think you are wrong.  FANG/FAGMAN (MSFT) have driven SPY lately."
e4xbfuo;schrodingerspup;1535417800.0;"The s&p 600 is the NEXT 600 companies AFTER the 500, it's not 500+100 with just midcap"
e4xfq4k;_rofl-copter_;1535421495.0;"Indeed, hmm and it's double the next biggest holding of SPXT. It has AMZN at ~ 4.41% of AUM, AMZN is up 101% the past year, so w/out AMZN we're looking at a 2.2% reduction but then we need to scale a bit for losing 2.2% of the old portfolio. So the 13.77% gains turns into 11.5% which scales to 11.76%, so call it 11.8% gains without AMZN. Should also add back in the expense ratio (0.27%) if we're comparing to the CBOE index since it has none and we should add back in the dividend yield too (1.63% + scaling for AMZN = 1.65%) since AMZN pays no dividend.Net all that, a pure index version of SPXT w/out AMZN over the past year should have done ~ 13.72% vs the 17.51% of the S&P 500. edit: I guess I could have just done this for all of FANG straight out of the S&P 500."
e4xcmw2;stockpikr;1535418847.0;"One thing you can do is to look at the S&P equal weight index which measures the performance of the same 500 companies, in equal weights. The  Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF(RSP) is up 0.63% today and 4.78% YTD."
e4x66i4;amy31415;1535413178.0;"It's SP500 ex-tech. There isn't one specifically for ex-FAANG. This is floating around, but I can't source the PDF (it looks approximately correct, though): http://ep60qmdjq8-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-16-at-10.24.24-AM.png"
e4xzwde;thisistheguyinthepic;1535439345.0;"FAGMAN keeps pushing the rest of the market from behind."
e4x8cec;jerschneid;1535415107.0;"Yeah, I think there's little to no overlap. My point is just that it's not like those 5 stocks are the only ones that are making gains and the rest of the market is doing nothing. Pretty much any decent sample size of US stocks when charted will look pretty much like the graphs above."
e4xcrjc;jerschneid;1535418961.0;"I don't think it's quite as simple as that. According to the [S&P site](https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-600) >The S&P SmallCap 600® measures the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. The index is designed to track companies that meet specific inclusion criteria to ensure that they are liquid and financially viable.Also there's an [S&P MidCap 400 index](https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-400), which would theoretically fall in between the 500 large cap and 600 small cap. I believe there's around 4,000 publicly traded companies in the US. I think these indexes are trying to take a meaningful slice from each capsize."
e4xzx92;thisistheguyinthepic;1535439370.0;"No it's not"
e4xpewg;_rofl-copter_;1535429808.0;"Ok, I just did it for SPY minus FANG. If you add back in the dividends and management fees, SPY has returned 19.64% the past 12 months. If you take out Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google and re-weight things properly, SPY ex-FANG would have returned 17.63%. The majority of the contribution is really just from Amazon: Facebook is basically flat Y/Y, GOOG is only up 30% vs 100% for AMZN, and Netflix is still a much smaller company than the other three. I'm not anti-FANG but if you are then I think it might not be wrong to short FANG at index weighting to eliminate your exposure to them. Or maybe just like half weighting or something to reduce it. The rest of the index has had a really strong year, hell even retail (XRT) has had a good year."
e4x6asn;wirsteve;1535413284.0;"This is great."
e4y07wz;bear_beer_beard;1535439667.0;"Ayy lmao"
e4x9c83;bear_beer_beard;1535415982.0;"A simple comparison of 1yr performance of FAGMAN and SPY shows that the former is dragging the latter up with it."
e4y0ab9;bear_beer_beard;1535439736.0;"It's 500, 400, 600. "
e4xtua2;wirsteve;1535433501.0;"Interesting.What I hoped to find was maybe a website so I could manipulate the data and find what I was looking for.You did it for me instead. +1I'm not anti-FANG, it has just seemed like those few stocks have been carrying the load for awhile, apparently not! Very cool stuff."
e4y2ygz;jerschneid;1535442505.0;"Right that's what I said. I just don't think those represent slices of the biggest 1500 companies. "
e4y6o5e;bear_beer_beard;1535446358.0;"I'm somewhat certain they do."

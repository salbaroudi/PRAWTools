9aa40q;InterstellarBlue;1535259629.0;How long do you have to pay back a margin?
9aa40q;InterstellarBlue;1535259629.0;"I'm researching margin investing (more out of curiosity, since I'm not too experienced with investing) and I was unable to find the answer to this question:How long do you have to pay back a margin loan? On Fidelity's [website](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/margin-loans/how-it-works), it says:>Interest charges are automatically posted to your account monthly. You determine the payback schedule and payment amount.What I'm curious about is what this means exactly. When *do* you have to pay back your margin loan? I'm sure there's some sort of time limit (based on the institution) or people would never pay them back. What's stopping me from investing in mutual funds on margin and then holding it for 50 years? I'm sure this would beat the interest rates (Interactive Brokers is charging something like 3%, which I'm sure a mutual fund could outdo on average over the course of 50 years)."

e4tvxl6;kiwimancy;1535261228.0;"There is no time limit. You just have to pay interest and keep your margin equity above the required level."
e4tvasd;userandaloser;1535260578.0;"They're glossing over margin calls... if the fund needs you to pay them back to remain solvent, they only need to give you 5 days notice.Also, if you're mutual fund underperforms you can end up owing more in interest than you earned from your investment. The interest rates at Fidelity are 7% - 10% depending on how much you borrow, so that is a pretty high bar to cross in terms of longterm performance. Where did you get 3% from? "
e4vbxv6;motterpaul;1535331505.0;"The interest is deducted from the cash in your account every month.Hint - if you don't hold stocks overnight you don't accrue that much margin interest.If you get a margin call you have to cover it ASAP or you will be restricted from trading  in that account (it will be frozen)."
e4twcr9;InterstellarBlue;1535261656.0;"Do you have to pay the interest off as it accrues, or can you just let it accrue? I'm still confused because it says you determine the payback schedule and the payback amount, so why can't I just to just hold for 50 years?"
e4tvmgk;InterstellarBlue;1535260910.0;"Interactive Brokers is offering as low as [2.41%](https://investorjunkie.com/12389/best-margin-rates/)."
e4u1a92;Michael_Pencil;1535266784.0;"Assuming you never get margin called and your equity value keeps rising you can also borrow the interest owed from your broker. I wouldn't advise it in the long run because the compound interest effect obviously continues even when your portfolio stagnates or even decreases in value.   Plus, using futures or far out, deep ITM options to leverage gets your financing costs a lot closer to the risk-free interest rate than any broker avalible to non-professional clients offers "
e4tzys2;kiwimancy;1535265349.0;"You can let it accrue up to the margin limit. If it goes above that, you get a margin call. If you do not put in cash or sell stocks quickly, they can sell for you, possibly at an unattractive level."
e4tw0a2;eskjcSFW;1535261307.0;"But how much margin do you need to have to get a rate like that?"
e4tw6ry;userandaloser;1535261488.0;"Because they charges fees or don't offer many other services other brokers perform for free... and you're talking about a far smaller company that may not be solvent for 50 yearsand also,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongFinOptions/comments/8ns0j8/just_wanted_to_say_fuck_you_to_interactive_brokers/"
e4tw9w9;InterstellarBlue;1535261575.0;"You need $1,000,000+ to get 2.41%, but the rate for $0-$5000 is 3.41%, which is still excellent. Check out the link I sent above."
e4tyct4;InterstellarBlue;1535263668.0;"So, you're saying that I would only face a problem if the entire company goes bankrupt? Are there any indications that this might happen?"
e4tzwqg;userandaloser;1535265285.0;"No, that's very obviously not what I said since I linked to a thread listing problems many other people have had with the company"
e4ubawy;RTiger;1535277545.0;"Another possible problem is rising margin rates. Especially those thinking they'll stay on margin for years, the rate might go up, might be by a lot."
e4uxg95;InterstellarBlue;1535314442.0;"Ah, I see. That would definitely be a problem."

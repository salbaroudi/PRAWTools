9ax7ik;WeeWillieWinkieHODLr;1535474429.0;"I have been thinking about increased international exposure.​I am invested in JD for exposure to China and I also like BZUN.​I have been very interested in AOS for exposure to China and India.  I also really like MELI for Latin America.  STZ also has good exposure to developing economies.​Just wondering which overseas stocks you guys find interesting, if yous are will to share ideas."

e4yt8yl;abrahamlincoln20;1535480169.0;"H&M, a former growth stock, now priced like it would never grow again. I think it will."
e4yw8nw;LCJonSnow;1535485428.0;"Honda. Cheap by almost any metric, with a solid yield with a small payout ratio. Earnings/revenue growth isn't huge, but it's positive, and I think we're due for a big swing back to smaller vehicles as gas prices increase. The fact the big 3 are focusing on big vehicles and removing chunks of their car lineup is music to my ears."

e4z14if;bigbassdaddy;1535491343.0;"$VEOEY - a sewer company in France.  Everyone's gotta shit."
e4yuv7r;jaug1;1535483232.0;"Nice call with $AOS, I like that company just not at this price.I like $SEDG for its share of the solar inverter market, its strong management, and possible synergies with the Gamatronic acquisition. Still very strong fundamentals, trading sideways for the past two quarters.I opened a big position with $BZUN in the middle of last year and closed it a few months ago. I think there’s a lot of potential but this company has no real moat and everything seems overvalued about China right now. I similarly closed positions in $BABA and $TCEHY.I'm watching Argentina and looking forward to some stability in there economy. Many of the Argentina ADRs will be buying opportunities once things settle down but, which is not a question of if but when (because in Argentina this happens every few years)."

e4z1ze4;dying_to_be_vain;1535492266.0;"If you like AOS for their emerging market exposure, I'd recommend taking a look at KONE Oyj.  They're a Finnish company that makes elevators and escalators, and are one of the top companies in this space (Otis, subsidiary of United Technologies, ThyssenKrupp, and Schindler being the other top competitors).   They bet big on China a decade ago and it's paid off - the other three companies are playing still playing catch up."
e4z3t6e;timeinthemarket;1535494057.0;"Tecent - Video games are a cash cow driving investments into all sorts of things. WeChat has a huge user base and is very integrated into Chinese life and is barely monetized at this point. Stock is priced reasonably considering the growth but unreasonably if you consider the Chinese company aspect as the government could do something silly any time.BABA - Similar story as above - lots of emerging market exposure here in various areas. If I wanted China exposure, I'd either be here or Tencent, the other stuff is too risky for me(JD/IQ/BIDU, etc.) and you often get exposure to a lot of other chinese companies by owning these two. Softbank - Cash cow with a lot of good investments, value of underlying investments not reflected in current stock price. FCAU - Recent death of CEO was a setback but he steered this company into a great position and hopefully that continues. They're net cash now which is good if a downturn is gonna happen in the next few years. There's a parts spin off or sale coming up soon which should unlock shareholder value. I can also see them spinning of Maserati eventually. This is my favorite car company right now. BAM - Great management, good value and a growing FFO. I like how the business is structured to suck cash from all the subsidiaries in the form of management fees. Good value at today's prices. "

Their economy is somewhat similar to the US economy in terms of structure (capitalism without Chinese-level of government interference although there is some). I also go to Brazil every few years and Brazilian friends come visit fairly often, so I get a sense of where their economy is heading. "

However this also means that wind energy is becoming cheaper and more accessible. I consider them a market leader and I think they’ll dominate the wind turbine market in the long run. "

e4z8ddo;ashiya2;1535498210.0;"I actually think nearly all auto stocks are wildly cheap. They all have a different situation / different issues but I think there's a real SOTP thesis to 75%+ of them. The issues they face are pretty simple to figure out:1) It's a bad industry. High fixed costs and low margins, highly cyclical, extremely competitive, global dynamics (trade, currency, etc.)2) No one knows how long it will take for EV/AV to be real and who will be left when it eventually occurs. I understand that cost parity with traditional ICE is expected to happen by 2025 and that companies are launching a slew of EV vehicles in the coming years, but I don't think anyone can claim real accuracy for when and who will be the ultimate winners. Frankly, I'm not even sure if Tesla will be a winner when it's all said and done. Until we reach then, expect capex & R&D to heavily outstrip D&A for a while (ie low cash earnings, which is a big issue for Daimler for example). The premium guys (such as Daimler and BMW) spend way more on EV/AV than anyone else. 3) Regulation is an issue, ie WLTP. But frankly if you are able to look past all of that, you can create a lot of these companies at very low multiples if you subtract out the value of their stakes in A, B, C and if you view their FinCo as a somewhat separate business and value that on a multiple of equity or just equity. I think for example GM used to trade at 7x earnings when it first IPO'd (could be wrong), but the S&P multiple was also lower than it is now. The multiple dispersion has gotten extremely wide, especially when you consider they have produced more cash yield relative to S&P since IPO. If you assume this Cruise thing is worth anywhere near what Softbank implies it at, then you have some ridiculously cheap stock value between the auto co and the fin co."

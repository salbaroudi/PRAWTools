9aqrud;yccheok;1535418523.0;"Alibaba seems to begin invest in offline store with their new retail technology.https://view.vzaar.com/15127363/videohttps://view.vzaar.com/15127562/videohttps://view.vzaar.com/15127283/videoIt seems this will enable Alibaba to collect more customers' data than ever before. Are you impressed by such move? Will this to be one of the factors, for you to invest/increase stake in BABA?"

e4y5m64;Hassan_Gym;1535445257.0;"Baba is a lifetime stock."
e4xjv1d;hokageace;1535425174.0;"I am in BABA because they are massive, have a lot of growth levers and dominance in a massive market. No 1 move will move the needle for me."
e4xv9ak;calculman3829;1535434768.0;"AMZN buys Wholefoods -> BABA goes retail tooBABA is a Chinese copycat with bad financials. If it wasn't for the chinese govt, they'd be at $0 already."
e4xy25p;DonArcher007;1535437502.0;"Bad financials?    Uh, no.         Chinese government involvement & support?  Uh, no. "
e4xyd1q;calculman3829;1535437802.0;"Are you joking me?BABA basically buys companies left and right and hides money losses in unconsolidated financials. They keep doing business with companies owned by their own executives (especially Ma and others).If you disagree on Chinese government involvement then you have never dealt with China. NO COMPANY operates at that level without chinese govt support and involvement. You get denied permits, get denied support, you get run out of town quickly. Notice what happened to Uber. It had to fold because Didi was the government's favorite company because they're chinese.[Look here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysomaney/2015/10/18/chinese-government-has-a-huge-stake-in-alibaba/#3b8f3df925b8)The goal of the communist party of China is to control everything to avoid revolutions that throw them out. Every company operating in China must provide the government with access to information to do this. Tencent and everyone else cooperates or there is no company."

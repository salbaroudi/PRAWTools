e4xouv0;FoolishChemist;1535429364.0;"NHI - holds retirement properties.  Very well managed, has good margins, pays good dividends, has been raising them for quite some time, has steady growth, picking up properties that are good deals.  When you compare their metrics to similar REITS, they're pretty much near the top.  The US is going to have a lot of old people in the coming years and we need to put them someplace.  I picked up some with it was in the upper $60s earlier this year and it has been very good to me."
e4xq4q2;txholdup;1535430395.0;"I have APLE which pays monthly, they own hotels mostly leased to Marriott and Hilton brands.  LTC, also pays monthly, owns senior care facilities, health care facilities.MPW, another medical REIT that pays quarterly.IRT, another apartment REIT, used to pay monthly, now pays quarterly.  APTS as stated, mostly owns apartments but has been branching out lately.All of these pay in the 6-7% range which in a REIT is about as high a dividend as I will buy.  "
e4xo9mb;maz-o;1535428876.0;"O - monthly dividends. not the highest yield but I like the consistency. long history and steady growth.NRZ - great yield over 10% decent growth too. not sure how long you wanna hold onto the residential/mortgage sector though but as of now this is my favorite."

e4xndsm;daviddavidson29;1535428142.0;"NLY - focuses on mortgages and has maintained their 11% dividend for quite a while"
e4yetao;Teufelhunden139;1535454948.0;"EPR Properties and Realty Income.  Bought the dip in March now I'm up 30%.  I hope simps freak out over rising interest rates again so I can buy more cheap."
e4yavdi;CaptainRevan;1535450665.0;"APLE and HST.Both hotel plays. APLE owns a ton of mid market hotels that are very recession resistant at thier average daily rate. Monthly dividends. Good management strategy.HST is quarterly dividends. Luxury and iconic hotels and resorts that, again, are somewhat resistant to recession given that they are either convention or central city locations that always have customers."

e4yhd5h;Jubenheim;1535457987.0;"STOR. It's made me almost a 20% gain since I invested early this year alongside the generous dividend it gives. I plan on investing more soon but overall, it's an amazing stock. I decided to invest in it after seeing it on Warren Buffet's list of dividend-paying stocks and it hasn't failed me since. Unlike soooooo many other REITS, STOR has actually experienced growth this year and doesn't seem to be stopping at all.I suggest you take a look at it. It's wonderful."
e4z42qe;TipasaNuptials;1535494307.0;"Lots of good options in this thread, so I'll add one that I don't see mentioned: LANDIt's a farmland REIT, pays monthly, yields ~4%. Farmland is a great diversification for any portfolio and is something that will always be in demand."
e4xosc9;dvdmovie1;1535429309.0;"EQIX, AMT. Growth and income. PLD less exciting but largest warehouse REIT and benefits from e-commerce.NXRT is a well-managed and somewhat unique tiny apartment REIT.ELS/EQC also of interest.Vornado (VNO) owns a lot of crown jewel NYC real estate and is undervalued, but the stock hasn't done a whole lot over the last 10 years. Additionally, Vornado's attempts to simplify its portfolio in recent years make it now largely reliant upon NYC. There is the continued hope that management continues to make efforts to narrow the discount as they have talked about."

e4xw8aj;wanmoar;1535435650.0;"GRT.UN - Granite REIT. It's industrial with most properties tenanted by Magna but reducing that exposure with every passing quarter. They also have a relatively no debt and exposure to Canada, US and developed Europe. Slap on a 5% dividend which is quite well covered at the AFFO level. CHP.UN - Choice REIT is a close second"

It's both a highly defensive sector (long leases with recession-proof tenants) but within a high growth market and with a manager that has done a good job so far.Similarly you have Northwest Healthcare Properties in Canada, which owns hospitals building in Canada, Germany and Brazil."

e4zsog1;OfficialHavik;1535515432.0;"Why buy individual REITS over a REIT ETF?? Unless there are individual ones trading below book or at a small premium over book, I don't see the advantage of buying them individually. Maybe the mREITS for the yield, but that's about it. "
e4zzo0y;tacofastball;1535521413.0;"I like Kimco (KIM), but the stock price has seen some pretty decent appreciation in the recent months, making it slightly less attractive of a buy.  Current dividend yield (paid quarterly) is just under 6.5%.KIM, which owns open-air shopping centers, got crushed over the past year by the "Amazon is going to kill every retailer in existence" hypothesis as well as fear over rising interest rates (despite the vast majority of their debt being fixed-rate like most REITs - they might even have a weighted debt term remaining of over 10 years if I remember correctly).  Pretty safe payout ratio to get you that 6.5% dividend, and they are still showing growth and can be expected to do a small dividend increase next year.  They are also attempting to re-position their portfolio to be primarily high-quality assets in major metro markets, and this has been executed on very well so far this year.  Once the "2020 Strategic Vision" (I think is what they are calling it) is complete, I expect their stock price to appreciate until the dividend yield is around 4.0-5.0% which is what comparable shopping center REITs with slightly higher-quality assets are trading at.  (Taubman, Macerich, etc.)"
e509wps;armastevs;1535531028.0;"NRZ those gains are impressive over the past 5 years"

e4xsdh6;MedicalLabScientist;1535432236.0;"Anyone who buys a real estate ETF with housing bubble 2.0 about to pop and interest rates rising is a damn fool."
e4xwx63;buttonsmasher2;1535436363.0;"> The US is going to have a lot of old people in the coming yearsThis will probably be a *very* valuable long-term thesis to act upon, not just in the US but around the developed world. The baked in demographic reality is already potent enough, but when you add biomedical science into the mix things get even more interesting. While I dearly hope that biogerontology will become a major field before I'm a decrepit nonagenarian, it's more likely that in the coming decades more conventional biomedical science (coupled with improved living conditions) will gradually push global life expectancy toward Japan's ~84 years and slightly beyond. That means *a lot* more 70-100 year olds who are better off in communal housing, assisted living, or nursing homes. Eventually all those distressed 7-11% yielding REITs that people love to rag on will see dividend growth coupled with steady price appreciation as they grow domestically and expand globally. Pair that with some low expense ratio healthcare/biotech ETFs and you've got a decent chunk of a cozy retirement portfolio. I averaged down heavily on SBRA, SNH, & WELL as they were bottoming out around February & I'm quite pleased with how that has worked out so far. LNGR is a cool fund but the expense ratio is too shit for me to invest heavily (as with most GlobalX funds). "

First, I'd suggest checking out their [website](https://www.m1finance.com) to see what it's all about.The short version is M1 Finance is a long-term investing platform that offers free use. You create "pies" which are actually portfolios. You can throw companies and ETFs into a pie, and you can have multiple pies in a portfolio. Each portfolio or pie must equal 100% and each individual "slice" (choice of company, ETF, or another pie) cannot be less than 1%. To achieve the percentages, M1 will grant fractional share so if you have $1000 and 10% in $AMZN, M1 will record you as having $100 of $AMZN in a fractional share.

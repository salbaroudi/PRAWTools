e4tz3wt;zachmoe;1535264438.0;"Author omits or misses the point on a couple items.  The end of article one he's talking about share price and then says nothing about market cap...  the second article makes the fallacy of needing to sell for a profit since it hit it's price target, this just makes a taxable event, over the long haul you would really just buy more instead of saying shucks should have sold when I was up, if the investment really has legs.  Also the second article has a chart of low to high risk investments, although I generally agree, there is no way to justify having index funds under low risk, they are composed of equity, nor are commodities low risk by any measure.  The difference in risk comes from amount of leverage in a lot of these which the author makes no mention of at all.Really seems to be using trader words and practices and understanding to describe investing which isn't right."

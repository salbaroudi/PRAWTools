9asm11;BlindintheEar;1535431423.0;Company requires transferring of external brokerage account to their platform
9asm11;BlindintheEar;1535431423.0;"Hi, I am starting at a new company and I have been using Robinhood for a while now, but this new company does not allow maintaining brokerage accounts that are not theirs due to something about the nature of securities industry. Is this normal and absolutely required? I would like to continue using Robinhood if I could due to having no fees."

e4xrt1u;flat_top;1535431775.0;"Yes it's normal and yes it's required. Companies may also restrict what you invest in or enforce minimum holding periods. It depends on your compliance dept though, so check directly with them for all of their rules."
e4xsluc;Vosslen;1535432431.0;"It's common and not illegal, although it's not a legal requirement for them they are just cheap and want to have an easier time monitoring employee assets. "
e4xuhsj;programmingguy;1535434078.0;"What company is this?"
e4yi734;czech1;1535459067.0;"Assuming you have a securities license, it's common. If not- then I'm not sure. "
e4yk0rb;ChekovsWorm;1535461686.0;"Do *not* fight your employer on this or try to get around it. Not if you value your future career, not only your job. You can lose both.This is 100% normal for all employees of any brokerage firm, almost all fintech and brokerage support firms, and many banking firms. Typically if a company has their own retail (for regular people not big companies) brokerage firm, all employees, and their immediate family members and anybody they share a financial household with, have to use it if they want to do any investing at all, no discussion allowed. Only exemption sometimes is if a spouse (etc.) works for a different brokerage firm which also has the same rule. In that case, you might be allowed to use the spouse's firm by your firm, while the spouse's firm insists that you use their firm. Statement and confirm copies have to go to your firm.If they don't have their own brokerage, typically they will give you a list of one to a few brokerages that they will allow you to use. Again, statements and confirm copies required. The approved firms are likely ones they know will cooperate willingly and efficiently.Nobody at your firm will give a damn about your Robinhood free trades. Pushing the issue will also make you appear disloyal, beyond being a violation. Usually if your employer does have its own brokerage, a lot of fees and minimums may be waived or reduced anyway. But if they don't, too bad. That's simply the reality of the industry."
e4yxehe;TheSnoLife;1535487036.0;"Yes itâ€™s normal. I had to do it too. Just curious where are you working?"
e4xtgu0;calculman3829;1535433172.0;"I am wondering, can they legally know if you have other accounts?"
e4z6tow;astearns31;1535496837.0;"Wait wait wait, so if I just graduated college and moved back home then got a job at say Merrill Lynch, that my parents would have to move their assets over for me to work for them? "
e4xucv6;BlindintheEar;1535433959.0;"I am wondering that as well."
e4z7r5a;ChekovsWorm;1535497664.0;"Could happen, yeah. If you are financially part of their household. Maybe even if you're just paying rent to them, given you'd still be immediate family member, but maybe not.Or you could use that sweet Wall Street firm salary to get your own place. /sThis stuff is taken seriously, because it can involve insider trading, restricted trading, all sorts of regulatory violations, so brokerages have to monitor all trades by all employees. And by anyone who might be a beneficiary financially, formally or just by being family, thereof. In some cases, even pre-clear (or deny clearance for) certain trades, but that usually applies only to people in the money side of things. Amy the Software Engineer and Paul the Admin Assistant usually don't need trades pre-cleared, but every employee has to have accounts monitored. "Use our own brokerage or GTFO" is the easiest way for the firm to do that monitoring.How hardass a particular firm gets can vary, but overall this is how it works. Want to work on financial services, expect this for your whole career in it."
e4xv37x;calculman3829;1535434613.0;"What stops him from opening an account in a company name and then trading, provided he doesn't commit any insider trading (I'd stay clear of any name he deals with and the company itself).Worst case you get fired. Open it in a state that doesn't require divulging ownership."
e4z9ioq;astearns31;1535499216.0;"That's pretty crazy "
e4yjqyn;ChekovsWorm;1535461275.0;"> Worst case you get fired.And blackballed from the financial services industry. Including being just "Joe Geek the programmer" or "Joe the Admin Assistant" or whatever it is you do. "
e4yk5v9;calculman3829;1535461912.0;"True, they could file a U-5 or whatever it is. They'd have to find out though."
e4yl30n;ChekovsWorm;1535463373.0;"Yeah but if their firm says "must only use us" they've taken all.other choices off the table."

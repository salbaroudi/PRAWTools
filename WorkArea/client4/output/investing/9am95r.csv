9am95r;Power80770M;1535375483.0;"I live in Washington state, which has zero state income tax. I'm also in the 35% federal marginal tax bracket. Finally, I'm worried about putting my money in stocks right now. So I've been looking at buying individual short term (less than 2 year) municipal bonds from all over the country. (If you live in a state with zero income tax, you can buy muni bonds from anywhere in the country and not pay federal taxes). I've noticed a lot of bonds rated BBB and higher ("investment grade") from places like Illinois, New Jersey, and Connecticut. These places are in the news quite a bit for their eternally heavy debt load. However, according to S&P, usually less than 1% of investment grade bonds default - this was true even in 2008-2009. Do I need to worry about putting my money in short term, investment grade bonds from these states?"

Certainly, if defaults were going to start happening, Trump's fucking over high tax states by eliminating the SALT deduction from the federal income tax code should kick things off.  While an increased tax rate might normally make munis look more attractive, the tax code also limited the states ability to lower corporate tax rates in high tax states through the use of munis (beyond the scope of this discussion).  End result?  Corporations leaving in addition to individual tax units (people).  At the end of the day, companies and people are who states tax in order to pay back bond investors.  Now the "feedback loop" narrative start to look very plausible. At some fundamental level, [you will arrive at something that looks like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2cDKyFdyU#t=3m45s)...but there are [some people who say there's nothing wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QD5M4f9SYY).My gut feeling is that even though pension obligations come before bond holder principal+coupons, politicians will slash pension payments before they'll jeopardize their ability to borrow in the capital markets due to even a "technical" default."

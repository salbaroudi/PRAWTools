9alwtk;finance-throwaway321;1535371835.0;"I'll be coming into a large sum of money soon, and I'm struggling to decide on using the services of a wealth management firm.I've invested myself for awhile (10+ years) and have enjoyed it, and done ok.  I feel like getting professional help would be prudent for a large sum (could be 10M+ after taxes), but I don't want to lose a lot to fees, ect. My goal is an early retirement for my family (after debts).What is the cut off for needing professional help?"

e4wf3zo;ron_leflore;1535372411.0;"If I were you, I wouldn't be thinking about getting help investing your money, but instead getting help to reduce the tax you are going to pay.When you are in the $10M range, you have to compare the fees you pay to the tax you pay.  If someone can help you reduce your taxes, they earn their fee."
e4wezl4;klf0;1535372248.0;"In my opinion, the cut-off is around a couple hundred thousand in new money (correct allocation and tax planning when circumstances change dramatically), or when you earn so much that your time is worth more doing something other than managing your money.I would think with the sum you're talking about, at least a fee-only planner would be worth a visit. And I might pay someone to manage it (1% annual, max). "
e4wgzpo;BiologistBro;1535375134.0;"Those quoting 1% are quoting mass affluent rates (100k-250k).  10mm at institutional pricing should be no more than 0.5% a year. 5-10mm should be between 0.5% and 0.7%.That should include comprehensive financial planning, retirement planning, social security and Medicare planning, estate design, tax minimization strategies, liability and risk planning, AND asset management investment advisory fees. Just FYI, 0.5% of 10mm is still a lot of money on an annual basis. Make sure you get what you’re paying for. "
e4wh48f;WealthMgmtThrowaway;1535375327.0;"This is purely anecdotal of my experience, so take it with a grain of salt.I opted to avoid most of the fees. I do use the private banking services of a few banks to get access to certain products, specifically financing collatoralized by my portfolio, but other than that, I still use Interactive Brokers and simply scaled up my allocation.Prior to this I considered myself a pretty passive buy and hold investor and I try not to pay too much attention on account that I hear that a common error is to be tempted to over trade. I was decent at restraining my emotions prior to my liquidation of private shares that caused me to have enough of a sum to consider wealth management in the first place. Prior to this I wasn't anywhere near cash rich enough to invest amounts to qualify.An unforeseen effect though was my daily P/L became much larger than I was used to. Even though as a percent it stayed constant, the absolute values kind of rocked me psychologically and affected my mood. I was checking my portfolio compulsively. Additionally, it made me a lot more slack in being prudent with spending. It became easy to justify excess consumption when the amount you spend a day is dwarfed by your daily P/L. This is something I can hopefully reign in by distancing myself from that P/L number.Another thing I'm doing is maintaining minimum balances to qualify for private banking at different institutions and just listening to what they have to say and comparing it against each other. If something seems okay, I might do it with the bank, but often I'll try to mimic the allocation on my own and incur less fees.I don't think I've considered relinquishing control to wealth managers and things seem to be going okay. The main issue is the aforementioned mental adaption to such large swings in daily P/L.A thing I have with against with the counter-party banks is they tend to try to push a lot of unnecessarily opaque products. These products look good at first glance, but obfuscate their true cost. Recently, a private bank relationship manager tried to sell an accumulator which was essentially a basket of options made to look very "in the money" and attractive. But if you break it down to its component options and compare the market price of those components, it was actually a huge rip off and would have been much more sensible to create yourself. Overall I think this works for me because I get some good advice from a few institutions, but still am comfortable executing at a lower cost by myself through my own brokers. I also invest quite passively and only reallocate once or twice a quarter. I just maintain minimum relationship balances for private banking through passively holding ETFs and get advice on my allocation every now and then. Additionally, I am in a low tax jurisdiction so that's one fewer thing I have to worry about that you probably should consider. I'm in a no capital gains / no dividend tax jurisdiction. ​​"
e4wk4go;bitflag;1535380564.0;"10M will definitely get you into private banking territory (usually starts around 2M depending on banks). I would argue to go that route because not only are they used to managing large portfolios, they are also a bank and regulated as such. You'll get access to most world markets, bonds emissions, multiple currencies accounts, cheap credit facilities, etc. which your typical broker doesn't offer.Fees should not be that bad, think about 0.2% of assets yearly."
e4wjvgu;-ayli-;1535380088.0;"You may want to check out /r/financialindependence and possibly /r/fatfire. The tl;dr is if you invest in a 70/30 stock/bond portfolio (you really don't want to go less than 70% stock for an extended retirement), you could spend $200k-300k/yr in perpetuity and expect to never run out of money, barring the collapse of Western civilization. You probably don't need a manager if you intend to put the bulk of your money in a lazy portfolio, although you may want to DCA in a few hundred k at a time, depending on the liquidity of the fund you're purchasing.You should also consider the tax situation - is the money after tax or in an IRA (traditional or Roth?)? Is there any way to structure the windfall so you spread it out over multiple years, which might reduce the tax burden? It may be worth talking to a tax professional regardless if you end up hiring an asset manager or not."
e4whfub;porncrank;1535375847.0;"Dude, I pulled off an early retirement with 2M. If you're getting 10M you should be all set. I had to be a little aggressive and take some risks but I've been OK. You could take a pretty safe and basic path and be all set.I'd say [just follow Buffet's easy retirement advice](https://www.fool.com/retirement/warren-buffetts-super-simple-retirement-advice.aspx). "
e4wy53a;HMFICOYF;1535405426.0;"If you’re not a financial guru and you don’t want to spend all your time managing your own money, I would definitely recommend working with professionals. At $10m, just about every wealth management firm will want your business. Use that to your advantage. You shouldn’t have to pay more than 0.85% all-in. That includes advisor fee, SMA fee, internal fund expenses. Make sure to ask about all the types of expenses.Included in the advisor fee should be complex financial planning that incorporates tax and estate planning. Since advisors are limited in those areas, they should be working along side your tax accountant and estate attorney for no extra charge. Go with the firm that focuses on what you are trying to accomplish in your life, what is important to you - do you want to travel the world, make an impact through charity, or maximize opportunities for your children? The advisors who try to figure out your life goals are usually the ones looking out for your best interest.If they act like they know when to get in and out of the market or they brag about better performance or pricing or whatever - I would be cautious. Finally, shop around. Talk to a big Wall Street company and also talk to an independent firm. Big companies can offer other things like lending but they often have major conflicts of interest. For example, their comp may be tied to selling you a loan. Independents might not have lending or insurance capabilities so ask them how they advise in those areas. And check FINRA broker check and SEC IAPD websites to verify the companies and advisors are legit.Full disclosure: I am an independent financial advisor. I compete for clients like you all the time and I hear about a lot of deceptive sales practices. So be careful - if it sounds too good to be true, run!"
e4wsccc;ZiVViZ;1535397802.0;"Would go and see someone, but don’t promise anything or commit to anything. "
e4wxjnn;big_deal;1535404782.0;"With that level of money you need to get some help with tax and estate planning. "
e4x0jrp;programmingguy;1535407917.0;"You sound like you'll be fine on the investment side and you are simple enough to not have lots of complicate finances...just a lot of money that will be coming into your bank account at some time. So outside investments, it's the other areas you want to evaluate.Better to go the flat fee route instead because know exactly what you are paying for and how much. If your financial goals are not complicated, you will just end up losing a ton of money going through the AUM route year after year. There are reputable flat fee advisors out there.Identify what kinds of services you need: Tax planning & Filing? Various types of Insurance?Managing rental properties?Large inflows of business income?Creating a trust? If your entire financial picture is not complicated, you could pay a flat fee for the initial planning effort to create and understand the road map you want to follow for the next five to ten years and then hire a specialist for those services in the road map if and when you need them. This is better than going by an AUM route where you pay atleast .50% to .75% as a HNW (higher if less than 1 million) so on a $10 million portfolio, we're talking about handing over $50,000 to $75,000 year after year for what in your case would be a small set of services that are not complicated. And those prices are on the conservative side. You could end up paying anywhere from .50% to .1.75% if you are not careful about who really handles your money.  Handing off your money to the management of a private client wealth management group doesn't mean you are now free from staying on top of it because they could do a ton of things against your best interests for achieving sales targets and increasing revenue (read the recent Wells Fargo private client exposes from Bethany McLean). The moment these institutions find out you are a HNW, they will be chasing you to be a client because there is year after year guaranteed revenue stream through the  AUM model and other ancillary services and charges.    "
e4x1ss9;OfficialHavik;1535409145.0;"My biggest concerns with that money would be estate planning, and limiting liability. You could be very passive with that kind of money and do well. Just don't go buy the Lambo tomorrow. Wait a bit for that one. "
e4xe3et;IndianaGeoff;1535420110.0;"A good money manager knows things you don't and has access to investments you can't.  I would get one."
e4xsrkh;retirementdude;1535432565.0;"As an advisor, it doesn't hurt to have a second opinion or set of eyes watching your portfolio. I have one client with a 12m account and I charge him a flat annual fee of 100k.Plenty of people will take you to the cleaners because they see your wealth as an opportunity to increase their own. In my experience, if you want someone to manage it do these things:1. Never disclose the precise amount of money until you decide who you want to use2. Use hypothetical's (what would you do for a million, what about four, maybe fifteen?)3. Perhaps pay for investment 'consulting' rather than active oversight/management You could always start out giving the advisor a million or so, seeing how he performs and how you two mesh. Give him more or find someone else based on those results. If they're not going to do it for a 'small' flat fee, it's probably not someone you want to work with."
e4wu4r4;firstreminder;1535400522.0;"Go to a firm that specializes in "high net worth investors" like Neuberger Berman. You'll get charged no more than 1% annually, but they'll know all the ins and outs of your local tax jurisdiction and know how to get you into the best tax advantaged state and municipal bonds. They'll tell you how to structure the trusts for your kids to avoid estate taxes and when you should be moving the money. Even if you decide you want to put all your money in TIPS, gold, and forex they'll be adding value far beyond their fees by saving you on taxes. You should also go to an estate lawyer immediately."
e4wx4km;MediaMoguls;1535404308.0;"This may not be a popular opinion here, but I would just drop the whole nut in Wealthfront and ignore it for 30 years. The fees are modest (though more than zero), but it will keep up with the market, rebalance, DRIP, etc, without you having to spend 1 second thinking about it. Knowing myself, I would otherwise be consumed by thinking about everything and questioning the investment decisions I made."
e4wfa2t;finance-throwaway321;1535372647.0;"Yes,  good point - thank you. The tax implications are concerning.  I'll seek professional help on that."
e4wf88k;finance-throwaway321;1535372575.0;"Thank you. My goal would be to preserve as much as possible, conservatively invest, and live on ~2% a year. My concern is the return on safe investments coupled with a management fee. If I could get it at 1%, this sounds possible. "

We are in a similar situation to above and this is one of the avenues we are considering.I know there are a ton that are basically useless. My concern with big banks are a lot of the people you get are new or not in industry long. We are pretty open to either in person in Ohio or California, or online. "

e4wgp7k;DarkLordKohan;1535374691.0;"You can get an income generating portfolio with individual bonds from a money manager for 0.70%. Yields 4%., so $400k a year with $70k in fees. 35 basis points to money manager and 35 bps to the advisor you talk to. Or you could split that money up and use half for income, other for growth somewhere else. A portfolio that big, if you pay over 1% in fees, the advisor is greedy.Also, seriously look into tax free bonds. You may get slightly less yield but fuck taxes."
e4whwi8;WealthMgmtThrowaway;1535376596.0;"If that's your threshold, you could just buy straight bonds of about 6 year maturities and keep rolling them. Investment grade i think you could get 4% YTM.I recently bought a basket of bonds with an average maturity of 6 years at about par with about 4% coupons. At 10MM that's already 400,000 a year.I didn't pay "fees" on it, but definitely got hit on the bid/ask spread of the bonds. I think the spread was about 3%. "
e4y59w3;DarkLordKohan;1535444902.0;".50% annual to advisor plus money manager at 35bps"
e4y6xaq;DarkLordKohan;1535446625.0;"Best way to do it is through a recommendation. See if anyone has good things to say about them. How long they’ve been around in the business. Look at credentials. Meet with them, and if you don’t like they way they look, sound  or smell, just don’t move money to them. Moving your assets to a new broker is super easy, so dont feel tied to one. If you dont need actively managed services and want a set it and forget it relationship, thats ok too. You get mutual fund breakpoints, so upfront is max 5%, down to <1% over 1m. They call you every so often to check in and tell you how you are doing. But mutual fund fees come out of pre posted returns, internal, so you dont technically see them on your statement. Fee based advisors deduct cash straight out of your account, so it can be jarring to see 20k leave your account every 3 months, even when they made you 100k."

9a7zz5;someoneataplace;1535243080.0;"I am a complete beginner that just signed up for an account but I am confused about the following:1. Upgrading to advanced features2. Enabling futures3. Enabling forex4. Applying for margin approval5. Applying for options approval6. Using thinkorswim vs. the web interface7. TiersIf I upgrade to advanced features, it says I permanently lose tools / features that will no longer be available but I also gain features / tools as well. I am not sure if the tools I am losing are worth the tools I am gaining. Is it worth it? What do all of the tools do? I would like to invest in every asset class that TD Ameritrade has available. If possible I would like to enable everything such as futures, forex, thinkorswim, and the web interface and use them all at the same time. Is this allowed or am I only allowed to use one or the other? To enable futures and forex, it says I need to apply for both margin approval and options approval. I do not plan on ever borrowing money on margin to invest. I would rather use my own money. Should I decline margin trading on the application?For options, there are tiers 1 through 3. Should I just go for tier 3 which seems to provide the most features? Or is there a catch that I am missing that makes it more beneficial to use a lower tier?"

You don't have to use it till you're more familiar/comfortable with it.Ask them if they'll offer you a non-published commision structure.  They might.  Personally, I prefer a flat rate for options contracts."
e4twxk3;ducatista9;1535262249.0;"When I moved to TD, they wouldn’t give me full options permissions even though I’d had it and been using it at my previous broker.  They wanted me to have a certain amount of experience with trading first.  They ended up saying because I’d had a 401k account for x number of years, that qualified me.  It was complete BS.  I think they’re just trying to cover their ass in case you do something stupid and immediately lose all your money."

Its unlikely they'd approve you anyway, unless you have opened the account with your trust fund or mega-millions winnings. Buy some index ETFs (or mutual funds). And spend some time to understand what the implications of buying on margin are. Or what hell go cliff diving before you have even learned to swim."
e4u6spo;Chroko;1535272781.0;"> I would like to invest in every asset classYou understand this means that you're going to suck at everything rather than just be mediocre at one thing, right?The investing universe is far too diverse and complicated to master everything. Professional investors spend entire careers focused on just one sector, which is why most amateurs fail when they try to compete against them."
e4tfeb8;EncarnacionNacho;1535244687.0;"Futures and forex are leveraged securities (might want to think twice before touching them if you don't have a grasp of how they work), if you want to trade them you would need margin. Know the risk of uncovered options if you are thinking of getting full option privileges.As for advance features it disables features on the website and moves them to TOS, and you loose AON FOK order instructions features on the website and TOS. I would reach out to them to clarify. "
e4ufy2u;UrboyJJ;1535282698.0;"They will only give you tier 1 since you have no prior investing knowledge. You will likely need to use their education and have a decent amount of money in the account for tier 2. Tier 3 you ain’t getting for quite a while down the road. Also you can have a margin account and not use your margin, kinda just depends on how you want to use your account. "

9aueyx;Dobroff;1535445885.0;"I am sort of confused by what happens to $PFE. As far as I understand, market is suspicious about it's high level of debt, and still stock price is slowly climbing up. Why so? Why Buffet seem to have trust in Teva and not in Pfizer? it suitable time to buy it? Any prognosis in general? Does anyone know how Pfizer managed to build that much debt?Thank you. Still very new to investing and trying to sort out things. "

e4y8yve;Throwawayacct449393;1535448739.0;"Look at TEVA and compare it to pfizer. Teva got bashed big time a few years ago and had significant loses on the books but most are from one-time bad decisions in terms of investments. TEVA is also huge in terms of generics which is essential to lowering healthcare costs. Pfizer on the other hand is a very expensive stock and has had a good run.​Buffet is a value investor which means he goes after stocks that are a good value AND have a good catalyst for growth. Case in point: TEVA. Buffet knows that teva is still a strong company that the market is not valuing properly due to short-term bias based on management's bad one-time decisions. Buffet knows that over the long-term TEVA will give strong growth. PFE on the other hand, could see a significant drop if they don't meet their earnings targets.Sell your PFE and buy TEVA. Buffet is one of the greatest investor on the planet so it is hard to go against his wisdom. He is rarely wrong.​Also with debt, make sure you compare it to similar drug companies. If PFE is the highest in the bunch then it is a red flag. I've owned stocks where investors were fearful of the debt load and eventually it crushed the stock....talking about 50% drop here. It took the company years to even get it under control back to realistic levels. During that time the stock was mostly in the gutter with no growth in stock price. Investors love taking on debt on the way up but when the level gets too high, it is time to hit the exit."

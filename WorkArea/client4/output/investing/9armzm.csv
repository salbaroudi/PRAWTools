9armzm;Mvewtcc;1535424496.0;Thoughts on buying S&P500 etf now?
9armzm;Mvewtcc;1535424496.0;"I'm a foreign trader from Taiwan interested in buying voog(vanguard S&P500 growth).  My initial plan was to use the daily kdj indicator and wait for the k value to drop to around 20 and buy.  The problem is I started watching voog at 150 and it keep climbing to 157 now. Fear of missing out, should I rethink my strategy and buy a small portion now and use dollar cost average instead?The money I intend to buy voog is around 20% of my asset.  Most of my money I have I bought local stock in Taiwan."

e4xtrmp;patricelaviva;1535433437.0;"i would not recommend buying the s&p500 right now since we are in the longest market upturn in history (close to 10 years). if you are not in a rush you should rather wait till the markets drop which they will at somepoint since markets are cyclical and we are currently in the boom phase i.e. the s&p500 is (close) to its peak.If you decide to buy right now you should be aware that markets might drop by more than 50% and you should be disciplined enough to hold your investment through that period to offset your initial paper losses through future market growth i.e. wait till the s&p500 catches up from the point at which you bought it."

e4yczr6;creepy_doll;1535452934.0;"On the flipside, outside of major changes in the status quo, the market should keep on trucking upwards. Why? Because productivity is constantly getting higher.The biggest risk is always going to be a big dip happening just before you plan on cashing out. Even worse if it's something like the japanese recession or the great depression which take a very long time to  recover."

e4y1o80;Timelapze;1535441162.0;"Sorry but 6months ago all the economic information pointed towards growth over the 18-24 month time horizon and international valuations we're more attractive than domestic equities (if you live in the USA).So far nothing has indicated, that I have seen, that the market is approaching a decline in the near term.

e4y4ct3;becuziwasinverted;1535443956.0;"Or just a stop limit that you manually adjust every day / week / month - depending on your risk tolerance. I always put a stop loss at 5 % below purchase price - once im up 5 % - stop loss goes in at just above purchase priceI know stop losses can be jumped, but better than nothing, very unlikely they will be jumped in ETFs "

e4y7kvw;Timelapze;1535447301.0;"It's not overconfidence it's just what the market commentary was at the time 6 months ago.All the economic indicators pointed towards continued economic growth over the 12-18 month time horizon. Now 6 months later we have hit all time high again. This market commentary predates the trade and tariff war but the fundamentals remain that international equities look to have favorable valuations and even equities as a whole seem to have more positive than pessimistic indicators.Again, I am just stating that the market commentary and economic reports and news didn't point towards downturn only volatility.Until slack runs out (workforce), inflation tics up, among a few other things such as yield curve inverting, it doesn't seem that the economic cycle has come to an end. So yeah I think moving to cash 6 months ago would have been counter to all the information suggesting otherwise."

e4y25kw;Timelapze;1535441651.0;"Well if you sold crypto 6months ago you sold around all time high and likely had more gains than you'll see in a lifetime of equities investing.However, Trump saying something is a blip in the radar. It's noise. The market is older than a presidency term and has weathered many presidents. American funds has a piece on how presidents don't have as much of an effect as people think.Fundamentals weight far more than short term 24 hour news cycles."

e4yaicn;userandaloser;1535450305.0;"No, this is a well-established principle of economics. Look, I understand that it might be counter-intuitive, but it's pretty annoying for you to reject an idea as asinine when you clearly haven't done your homework.Here's an easy-to-read explanation of why your gut reaction is wrong (spoiler alert: you're ignoring the effects of compounding your gains):https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/barry-ritholtz-time-not-timing-is-key-to-investing-success/2014/08/21/b3443d9a-27d2-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?utm_term=.c218f6911594"
e4yl9pn;booostedd;1535463673.0;"Not sure why you are down voted. This is a great super easy thing to do on ETFs since they are generally less volatile, and a good way to deal with shorter term investments to ensure you lock in gains."
e4yh1y3;yankee-white;1535457594.0;"> but also more shareholders to split the earnings over.Number of shareholders? What a strange complaint on growth.... The number of shares matter, not the number of shareholders. You seem confused on how the stock market works. "
e4y81bk;swerve408;1535447778.0;"Why does everyone think it has to be all cash or all in the market? You can take some off the table lolAnd all the economic indicators? I’m pretty sure pmi was on the decline all of spring. But I’m not disputing that because I really don’t care that much for economic indicators, I’m just cautioning people of being so over confident "
e4y29d7;doogie88;1535441762.0;"Yes I had very good returns. So I'm trying to put into something somewhat safer. I guess that's why I was hesitant I didn't want to put it into something which I wanted to be 'safer' and it takes a dive shortly after."
e4y8ccl;swerve408;1535448092.0;"Its funny, the same people saying “the market always goes up, look at history” also say “past performance does not guarantee future results”It’s not a one fits all game. Different investors have different risk levels and that should determine their allocation levels. To say someone should be invested in the s&p500 at all times regardless of price because they are going to miss out on gains (assuming this is not solely a retirement account) is not proper advice "
e4ztj5w;tragicdiffidence12;1535516154.0;"Yeah, I don’t get it. I think in this sub, they frown on market timing and the general advice is to hold through weakness, which is fine advice 99% of the time. I’d just suggest a large stop loss because ideally you don’t want to get caught in a bear market. That’s said, you would have been stopped out of the nasdaq and s&p in q1 and missed the rebound. "
e4yhzbp;creepy_doll;1535458783.0;"If the market is flush with buyers they have to pay more for a share of that competing to get at it. This drives up the price and the actual intrinsic value(the share of future revenues) remains the same, just more people want a piece of it.This is why bubbles occur when everyone gets in on the market. People speculate for smaller and smaller amounts of the intrinsic value or hope that it is valued for more. There are no bargains because there are not enough good stocks to go around because there are many buyers.But when the market crashes because people realize those speculative gains just can’t happen and aren’t supported by the underlying revenues, lots of people jump out.The intrinsic value of the stocks barely shifts, but the prices are down due to low demand because there are fewer buyers.the fundamental value of stocks is a stake in the ownership of the company and a share of its future revenues. If the population doubles and the prospective shareholders double that is a zero sum effect on the market as a whole, with per-person increases coming from productivity increases.The only way population increase helps is if for some reason proportionately fewer of them decide to join the market(though it certainly helps the stocks you’re holding from before the increase, but I’m talking about the market as a whole here)"
e4y8fty;Timelapze;1535448190.0;"Of course don't read stuff from Reddit and believe it as the gospel truth, but I'm talking about:* CPI* PPI* Unemployment falling* Wages rising* Rates rising* Business related spendingEtc.DYOR but from someone who reads the economic news and follows the weekly commentary, you should probably do that too before pulling out to cash.Also unless you have a use for the cash within 3-5 years, it shouldn't ever be more than 2% of your investment portfolio.I.e. money with a 5+ time horizon shouldn't be in cash."

e4za22f;swerve408;1535499683.0;"True but let’s not imply that I’m going to cash, I just find other things more advantageous to invest in other than the broad market because of the more favorable risk/reward."
e4zabls;Timelapze;1535499915.0;"Modern portfolio theory would imply having some allocation to US Large Cap, so whether you're in cash or some other asset class, you're taking additional unnecessary risk and playing short term bets akin to gambling. But if you're talking about your non-qualified gambling account that's totally fine. If it's your retirement account, that's somewhat wreckless."

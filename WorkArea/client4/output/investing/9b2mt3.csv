9b2mt3;JimBoonie69;1535517973.0;"Have some free time and want to learn some machine learning/AI type things. Wanted to build a program to analyze/backtest picking various stocks/indexes etc. Was wondering if folks here have any experience, is it worth the trouble?My thought for first idea was, can i find a random combo of 10 S&P stocks that would outperform the index over past 20 years??? Who knows. just wanted to throw it out there. If i start making money i will get back to you all :p"

e4zx6hi;enginerd03;1535519255.0;"This post in algotrading sums it uphttps://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/96mjt2/some_final_wordsTheres a ton of backtesting and infrastructure platforms. Programming another is useless and worthless. Cs majors think it's a good idea but the value is always in the strategies not the platform to backtest one. "

It works great, I don't know if it made more or less than perhaps other services, but it saved me from having to find the loans and fund them myself.  I have not made money selling the software, just using it to auto invest for me."
e4zzcoa;Leylennnn;1535521134.0;""Some free time" would get you working on a project for yourself, such as the one you mentioned, that you could use for your own stuff. You wouldn't actually have enough time to make something valuable enough to make money on that other people haven't already done years ago. "
e4zx1rs;wwwyzzrd;1535519140.0;"Not really worth it, in terms of making money. (obviously, if it works, you'll make a mint).There are very, very smart, highly paid mathematicians and computer scientists doing this already, so competing with them is tough.You'll definitely be able to find a random combo of 10 that outperform over the past 20 (that is basically trivial), but you need stocks that outperform over the next 20. Your framing of the question makes me think you'll need to do some research and serious learning to even start understanding the scope of what you want to do.Definitely will be a very interesting learning experience for you if you decide to go down this route in terms of research and (for example) start attempting to build predictive models. I wouldn't recommend putting any money behind it until you're at a much more advanced place in terms of you knowledge of the problem. (If ever)."

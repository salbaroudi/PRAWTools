9aqnfc;ObjectiveMongoose;1535417723.0;Suddenly need to live off of my investments. How does my vanguard allocation mix sound? Bonus question: How to plan for moving investments from a financial advisor to myself, how is Vanguard flagship program?
9aqnfc;ObjectiveMongoose;1535417723.0;"Hello! I have bombarded r/financialindependence far too much as I navigate my finances, and this question is far more "investment" focused than FIRE.About me: I am 28 y/o, have about 1 MM net worth. I am suddenly having to live off of my investments for the foreseeable future due to family circumstance and having to be a full time caretaker. I do bring in a few hundred a month from various side projects. My yearly expenses are to the tune of 30k, no debt. Until recently, I was very cautious and not investing what I should, so I'm trying my best to mitigate that.Current allocation: Merrill Lynch 25/65/10 for fixed income/stocks/cash. That had been bringing me in around \~1.5 k a month, which was a great bonus bit of cash while I was working, and the rest was growth. This is after the 1% fee to my advisor who manages my portfolio. That's for about $750k. I have about 10k in a Roth with them.The remainder of my funds I have been moving into Vanguard. I am hoping that without the 1% fee, I can use the growth from my Vanguard acct + the 3% draw from ML to have a cumulative interest in the 25-30k range which would allow me to take care of my parents until we figure out a more reliable assisted living situation for them. I had that money uninvested as I was planning on using it for a house and some other career related expenses, but again my circumstances have changed severely so that money is now available for investing.Current planned Vanguard allocation:  70/30 stocks/bonds with the 30 in BNDThe 70 stocks to be 60 VTI/40 VXUS.... I'm wondering if I should switch 80/20 stocks/bonds or 70 VTI/30 VXUS?How does my current allocation sound?In terms of my ML assets; I really like my financial advisor. He has been really helpful in assisting my navigation of my finances, starting my own business, etc. But now that I'm hoping to live off of my investments, that 1% is really steep. I saw that Vanguard has a flagship program where you can get a free financial advisor past 1 MM. However, I have no idea how to move my accounts that way or how to navigate my current stocks with ML. Also, before I learned about the flagship program, I was hoping to just move to Merrill Edge; I have their premium rewards credit card, and it seems for self management, that Merrill Edge is not too different from Vanguard with the added benefit of me already being tied up in ML.My options are as follows:---- Move my own vanguard amounts to ME, same ETFs and there is no fee for doing so. Keep the current ratios.----Same as above but slowly move more of my investments into my own control with ME. I would need guidance on how to do this.---Keep my vanguard amount in vanguard, slowly move over investments over to vanguard----Move everything into vanguard once I'm feeling confident enough to do so and utilize their free advising serviceI have been trying to read as much as I can; I recognize that I have not made the best financial decisions and am now trying to mitigate those mistakes.TL;DR: How does my stock allocation sound? What would you change?For the future of my finances, should I stay with what I know and an advisor I trust? If I decide to branch out, what way should I do so and how?"

This will also give you around $1.6k income a year or maybe a savings account with same percentage.Put $400k into a SPY ETF which should give you around $7k a year.Put $500k into established blue chips with around 3% yield. That should give you $15k income.This gives you around 22-24k income which is relatively safe and will grow. You can reduce your bond allocation and put it into stocks if you need a bit more."

e4xcgit;logan343434;1535418689.0;"I'm confused so you make around 1,500 in dividends from 750K investments? And you make another few hundred a month from side projects? Any reason you can't be a caretaker and live off 2K a month? Personally, I think 750K in equities is too much, I would have taken some of that as a downpayment on a rental unit a long time ago and made passive income on that. "

Currently I have 487k in stocks, 180k in fixed income./bonds  I have an 250k that is totally uninvested that I am moving into Vanguard, which is what I was asking about the allocation ratio for. "

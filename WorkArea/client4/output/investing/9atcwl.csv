9atcwl;josh6286;1535437076.0;"I just switched to TD Ameritrade a few weeks ago, and I hate it. My main complaint is that they take their sweet ass time doing anything. Took 2 weeks to transfer my roth. Took a week for deposited funds in my taxable to become tradable. Has been 4 days and my options application has no update. They said it would take 24-48 hours. They don't reply to emails quickly at all. I'm tired of this. Investments often need to be made when the time is right.What online brokerage firm do you use that has the **best customer service**?"

e4xxpd4;hi_ho_silvers;1535437151.0;"Iâ€™ve had exceptional service from Fidelity. "
e4y98hc;janto98;1535449016.0;"E-trade is much faster than that and has great customer service"
e4ydiae;ScottishTrader;1535453500.0;"Not sure who you talked to at TDA but I get amazing service from them!TOS has a chat feature where I can answers in minutes, although during the trading day it can take a few for them to come online.You should call up and ask who your rep is and then ask that they call you.  Let them know your experince as I have to think it is a fluke!As a side note, I have also had great service from Fidelity."
e4yjna7;ChekovsWorm;1535461123.0;"Both Schwab and Fidelity have excellent customer service. Fidelity is completing ACATS transfers within a couple of days nowadays, though they'll still tell you it takes about a week. I put one in on a Tuesday early-AM in the overnight period, and the securities were in my Fido account Wednesday afternoon.Granted it was an existing account at Fidelity, and only a partial securities transfer from a different brokerage (one that uses Pershing as its clearing broker), but it was ultra-fast.Schwab ACATS and even non-ACATS TOAs from things like transfer-agent-based DRIP/DSPP have never taken more than 5 business days and normally 3-4. Haven't done one since before their recent upgrade to their online transfers system. A full account transfer and closeout of my Roth into Schwab from another firm took only 3 days. I already was an existing Schwab customer with a login, a taxable and a traditional IRA, so the Know Your Customer and user ID setup stuff was already done. But that was pretty quick 2 years earlier when I was entirely new to them.Both have really excellent phone support, and fast response to online secure mail after login to their websites. If I had to pick one, I'd say Schwab is slightly more responsive to online secure mail, as in few hours vs several hours for Fidelity. "
e4y2i7o;SirGlass;1535442025.0;"when opening a new brokerage account it is standard practice to put a hold on funds transferred in via ACH .I would suggest Schwab however they will do the same thing, if you transfer money into schwab from an outside bank account it is frozen for about 10 day.Note that only happens to the first few transfers now it is immediately trade able .Also 2 weeks doesn't sound un-reasonable to transfer a roth"

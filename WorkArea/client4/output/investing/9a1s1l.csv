9a1s1l;AppropriateSplit0;1535178046.0;"Well, it's been a great few days.How do you guys approach profit taking? Even if you're in it for the long haul, I imagine there's some realizing of gains before another roller coaster. Can't really make much if you hold forever (dividend guys - I know). Was curious about this sub's perspective on this.Personally, I'm big on preserving capital. I like to take out my seed money if it doubles but lately I'm thinking taking out the initial investment at 50% gains. Thoughts?"

e4s7yss;1stBaronKelvin;1535183452.0;"You need to have a plan.If you aren't going to hold long term you need to know your exit plan before you even get in."
e4s3epk;kiwimancy;1535178754.0;"I've noticed a lot of people have been asking this recently."
e4shu2y;jonp217;1535194100.0;"I'm not sure yet if this is a good strategy or not but I started selling shares that I've kept for more than a year if the stock has underperformed for that year when you compare it to the S&P 500. "
e4s6ev7;becuziwasinverted;1535181816.0;"I set a stop loss and move it up at 3 % below the price - i could see 1 or 2 % swings being a daily occurrence but at 3 % down, I want to save my profit until I figure out what’s going on, Worst case I’m paying commission for no reason, best case I buy back in at cheaper prices "
e4u1k8n;Throwawayacct449393;1535267091.0;"You need to rebalance your portfolio to make sure you aren't overweight in equity. I am also in the process of rebalancing myself. Trying to figure out which ETF to move the money to."
e4s8bu6;AppropriateSplit0;1535183835.0;"Definitely something I'm finding out now. Hence the thread "
e4s49t9;AppropriateSplit0;1535179633.0;"Probably goes hand in hand with good times"
e4srnb6;AppropriateSplit0;1535208089.0;"I don't think that's a good strategy at all. "
e4s73zo;AppropriateSplit0;1535182551.0;"I can see that working for very active traders. Not a bad plan at all. "
e4u1n68;Throwawayacct449393;1535267182.0;"That strategy only works for non-volatile stocks, maybe blue chips. For any of the big movers, TSLA, FB etc they all can move +/- 5% in a single day."
e4s9ngf;1stBaronKelvin;1535185227.0;"Okay.So you're going to need to have more of an understanding of the company and how the stock behaves. Maybe stock ABC trades at $21 and you think it should go to $25 due to some catalyst in the not so distant future.So you decide if it drops to $20 you'll buy and then sell if/when it hits $25 or if it drops to $18.Obviously picking specific price targets and trading takes a lot more research than a simple bullish buy and hold./eDon't just sell your position because you're made too much money. If you thought Amazon was overvalued at 700 then you've missed huge upside.If you don't have a good reason to sell outside of the fact that the performance has been good then hold or sell some portion."
e4t1m93;jonp217;1535229188.0;"Why?"
e4u6bza;becuziwasinverted;1535272300.0;"Yep! You’re right! I use this strategy with AMZN MSFT V BABA FB If any of them move 5 % per day to the low side, I’ll be more than happy to get stopped out and pick up cheaper shares with my saved profits! "
e4srra1;AppropriateSplit0;1535208299.0;"> Obviously picking specific price targets and trading takes a lot more research than a simple bullish buy and hold.This is the main issue. I've got a pretty good record of picking winners but I really don't have great skill when it comes to analyzing when a good entry point emerges and when it's time to go. So my gains over the years have definitely been hampered as I should have bought in or sold earlier. This is besides the usual "could've bought at the absolute lowest and sold at the peak" line of thinking.>If you don't have a good reason to sell outside of the fact that the performance has been good then hold or sell some portion.That's what I'm looking into. I was thinking of sticking to a new rule of always taking out the original investment at 50% gains or when it doubles but, again, the lack of proper analysis makes that a challenge. "
e4t67r5;AppropriateSplit0;1535235235.0;"It doesn't take the holding's specifics into account. There may be a good reason why its not performing at this point in time vs the S&P but is still a great investment on a longer time horizon. Many investments don't show results in the first year and dumping it solely because of that isn't a great idea. "
e4u9133;Throwawayacct449393;1535275119.0;"Right but isn't the overall idea to basically "ride" the upward movement while still having your "hand" on the eject button so to speak? Seems like if you aren't willing to take at least a 10% loss then you won't be able to ride the wave for any long-term rate."
e4t7rk3;jonp217;1535236924.0;"I wouldn't be dumping the whole stock. I said I would sell the shares that I've held for a year. Throughout the first year I would be adding to my position but if the stock still doesn't perform up to standards a year after the next time I bought  more shares then I would sell only those shares. I would reevaluate at each anniversary that I've bought shares. If it outperforms the S&P 500 then I would start buying again. The amount of time I would hold a stock would be about 2 years because in the first year I would be adding throughout the whole year. With this strategy I will be taking profit but I won't be holding onto underperforming stocks just because I have an emotional attachment to them. "
e4u963l;becuziwasinverted;1535275270.0;"Very true - the most amount of loss im willing to take is commission! So if I’m up 5 % - stop loss going in, if I’m up 6 %, stop loss stays at 5 %  - until I’m up 9 % then the stop loss will be moved to 6 % so on and so forth This strategy allows you to get 5 % this week and free your cash on the stop loss and then invest in something else Rather than Go up to 5 % then down to 3 % then back up to 5 % in two weeks Time is money. "
e4t8b6c;AppropriateSplit0;1535237492.0;"This is far different from your first post."

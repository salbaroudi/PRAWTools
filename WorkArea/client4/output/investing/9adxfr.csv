9adxfr;CryptoBick;1535297842.0;"There's been a bunch of new real estate initial coin offerings, including Templum [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180808005549/en/Templum-Markets-Launches-Digital-Security-Offering-St](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180808005549/en/Templum-Markets-Launches-Digital-Security-Offering-St)and NYC Real Estate Coin: [https://nycrec.io/](https://nycrec.io/)  These interest me because they're new but I'm not sure if they'll be successful. Could make a lot of money or lose it all on those ICOs.  My question is: Which way do you all prefer to invest in real estate?   I currently hold some REIT stock and have  housing-related stocks like Home Depot.  Don't have any rental properties, though I'm looking. "

e4utjf1;CaesarsCaesarSalad;1535306049.0;"I prefer REITs simply because of the lower entry costs (no deposits needed) and practically no hassle compared to owning property directly which means dealing with annoying tenants and damages etc. The biggest advantage that owning actual property has over a REIT is the leverage however. I don't know much about ICOs, apart from an awful lot are scams. Why exactly does this sector need a token/coin?"

e4usjk3;Throwawayacct449393;1535303655.0;"Avoid the ICOs, very likely they could be a scam. Also they will not give you a higher ROI compared to REITs. If you want to buy property then stick to REITs. I wouldn't buy property directly unless you can do all cash to buy up several properties which you plan to actively manage. Otherwise, you are better off just sticking with REITs and then focusing the rest of your time to career. Always rent your primary residence as it gives you maximum flexibility for career movement."

There was a guy on WSB who took out a second mortgage to buy Tesla after the going private news came out. He is gonna lose a lot of money."

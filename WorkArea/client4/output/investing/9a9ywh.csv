9a9ywh;UsernameTemporary;1535258407.0;Should I sell my AMD Stock?
9a9ywh;UsernameTemporary;1535258407.0;"Been holding my shares for over a year. Avg cost of overall shares was $10.77. Appears to be very high at around $24. Would it a great time to let go of these? Been having a hard time letting go. I’m glad I haven’t yet."

e4ttltv;VacationLover1;1535258815.0;"Since you doubled your money and are having a hard time letting go, why not sell half? If it goes down you got your initial investment out of it and are letting the gains ride. "
e4ttcei;eskjcSFW;1535258544.0;"If you need the money yes if not keep holding."
e4ttdwi;badgerhairs123;1535258588.0;"You better not"
e4vdjdj;jtrthehax;1535333048.0;"Could take a large chunk of profit and then buy close ITM 2020 calls with the money left. Tons of leverage for a move up"
e4u6tiw;badtradeseveryday;1535272804.0;"Sell half for other opportunities and keep the remaining to sell calls against "
e4udkbc;SCal_Jabster;1535279993.0;"Sell them, sell them all. You have done 0 research. You doubled your money and that is really good. Take the money or look into the company. Never hold something you don’t feel comfortable with."
e4uost3;-walkingonair-;1535295508.0;"Look at the volatility of the stock itself...market looks due for a pull back so I'd guess wouldn't hurt to take profit...may go up some more sure, but be glad you won't watch money fall at some later time could be one way to look at it"
e4xa9cd;MindFuktd;1535416784.0;"AMD is in risky pump/dump territory. You are high risk high reward right now. May as well lock in extreme gains and look for a lower entry (it will come). End of day massive selloff would not surprise me."
e4ttgaq;alexisawesomenessinc;1535258657.0;"As someone who is long AMD, I think it's definitely overvalued at this point. If you're looking to buy back in later, you should at least wait until it hits 20 again, but I'm personally looking for an entry around 15 (margin of safety). This is an unreasonable valuation in my eyes."
e4tv46g;UsernameTemporary;1535260386.0;"Great idea. Wouldn’t hurt to sell half instead of all of it. Thanks for the suggestion!"
e4tukzz;UsernameTemporary;1535259825.0;"Don’t need the money now but definitely want to make sure I’m not making the wrong move by holding at a good selling value"
e4tv1f2;UsernameTemporary;1535260303.0;"Thanks for the input. I would definitely buy back later at a reasonable price. I only had these stocks for over a year and seeing the current price got me really thinking about selling "
e4unkxi;01123581321AhFuckIt;1535293242.0;"15 seems kinda low. I see it around 17.50. "
e4vku65;xenophobias;1535340160.0;"Sell 20-30%. Then sell 20-30% at 28-30 and let the rest ride out IMO."

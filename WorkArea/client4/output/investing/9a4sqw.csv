e4sv9nb;genericscotch;1535215878.0;"KO looks awfully expensive to me.  At the current price they have a 3.4% yield paying out two thirds of their income (on average) with hardly any growth.  I could see it as a riskier alternative to a treasury, but I wouldn't expect huge returns."
e4ss0c7;BaskinRobinson;1535208781.0;"What else do you have in your portfolio?"
e4tiwcq;StacksOnStacksOnStax;1535248105.0;"KO will underperform the market for the next 10+ years. More scientific evidence will come out about just how bad sugar is for you. Revenues will slow and organic growth will decline, share price will fall.  The only reason KO has stayed afloat is because of expensive acquisitions into other areas. Thus, if you do a simple discounted cash flow analysis, KO is very expensive. Look closely at capital expenditures and acquisitions and you will see the level of free cash flow is not that great (relative to current stock price)."

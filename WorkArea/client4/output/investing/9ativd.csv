9ativd;ccperry;1535438403.0;"The stock market has been really good lately.  Reminds me of January before the February crash this year.  Anybody else nervous?"

e4y06zv;BenoitFamCounciling;1535439641.0;"Yeah I'm terrified, the market is going up.  I wish it was crashing so I could feel safe."
e4y0icp;nrps400;1535439968.0;"If you bought in January you'd be up"
e4y7eh7;Juniper00e;1535447114.0;"Every day it's either this or an AMD question."
e4xzph1;GG_Henry;1535439153.0;"Feels like q1 1919 tbh "
e4y2wez;tragique;1535442443.0;"Yes it makes me very nervous. The economy is doing great, which leads to companies being profitable, which in turn leads to the stock market showing good returns for it. I am terrified. I just wake up every day and wish we entered a deep recession or financial crisis that caused most people to lose their jobs, so I could feel safe and calm again."
e4ypyhh;Radeh;1535472842.0;"I trade ES (S&P futures), so can easily go long & short...which means I don't really give a rat's ass which direction it goes. I just follow momentum. Pretty clear what current momentum is, so no, I am not nervous at all ;)"
e4xz1vp;eskjcSFW;1535438494.0;"prepare for impact"
e4xz1av;badtradeseveryday;1535438478.0;"My balls are tingling and they tell me there might be a big red day before 9/21 so I’ve been stacking up on puts"
e4xz3ux;Sunchaser703;1535438550.0;"It’s starting to feel like 1999"
e4y5iyb;Kunu2;1535445165.0;"No this does not feel like January. Day after day I saw incredible gains it was like a video game. Past two weeks have been picking up volume as summer's end nears."
e4y92fx;radivoer;1535448840.0;"This didn’t go as you expected"
e4yc26a;danellender;1535451894.0;"Bears have eyes on benefits from tax cuts fading,  1T Student loan debt, rising interest rates, flattening yield curve, increasing volatility, Jumpy Trump, Situation normal."
e4y4f3q;buck9000;1535444023.0;"God yes. The powder keg in Washington coupled with all time highs could/should make for a cataclysmic move when shit finally hits the fan, as I expect it will sooner or later. "
e4y5t37;logan343434;1535445460.0;"When everyone is greedy, yes it's time to be fearful. You can smell the bubble popping soon. Only inevitable. "
e4y3q2e;becuziwasinverted;1535443307.0;"Put stop losses on all your positions that would save your initial capital at the VERY least. Then buy SQQQ, and other leveraged short ETFs, but ONLY if we are actually in a recession, not because $PZZA is not selling enough pies "
e4y8dpn;nealosis;1535448131.0;"I’m scared for my 401K but my day to day trading could care less. "
e4ycwob;CanYouPleaseChill;1535452842.0;"Yes. I'm nervous whenever I see behaviour in the markets which is very pro-risk. There seems to be little discussion of valuation as people pile in to overvalued stock after overvalued stock. "
e4zaq9n;cjbrigol;1535500262.0;"As is tradition "

e4y0pnt;maz-o;1535440177.0;"are you partying like it though?"
e50f3jg;ThatOneRedditBro;1535536018.0;"Things are just getting started baby. We have at least 2 more years before things start to fade. Trump will be re elected if everyone's making crazy money next year. You posted things to consider but it's the biggest tax break in history. I'd we deliver it's gonn a make history "
e4zl1qr;Delta_Dash;1535509025.0;"Everyone is fearful right now though."

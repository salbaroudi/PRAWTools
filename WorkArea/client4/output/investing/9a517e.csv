e4stlzg;jerschneid;1535212102.0;"Man... I'm not a gambler, and I don't like shorting stocks, but this company feels like it has a dying userbase, everyone is going to instagram, not much innovation and it's still valued at 15B. I can't really imagine a world where it's BIGGER a year from now..."
e4su4s2;Throwawayacct449393;1535213273.0;"Yes, the platform is slowly dying."
e4t0rg2;Juniper00e;1535227806.0;"Unlike instagram they don't restrict nudity or sexting so it is the only advantage it has left. Porn on snapchat is rampant."
e4tj41w;darealrobertmcd;1535248316.0;"You missed the short train when it was at $20 in February. Shorting it now is a gamble "
e4teyj9;userandaloser;1535244253.0;"You should have shorted it after the IPO. It's already fallen so far that it's hard to know where the stock will go."
e4swb8h;Surveyer13579;1535218356.0;"No. Look at their ARPU growth and usage penetration among those 25 and under.  In the US, the 25 and under crowd like and use snapchat more than instagram - and the US segment is worth much more than the rest of the world in terms of potential ARPU. &#x200B;They could be a money machine.

e4tpazu;Hassan_Gym;1535254477.0;"I don't use Snapchat anymore. Snapchat is slowly dying, everyone is moving to Instagram for DM's/etc. "
e4tk5qp;Ishmael_Vegeta;1535249344.0;"There is risk they get bought out."
e4t14qr;Juniper00e;1535228421.0;"I think it has potential but I don't see them doing much."
e4sx80f;Gareth321;1535220531.0;"I really hate that I agree with you, but my wife uses it religiously. I just don’t get it, but for people who do, they love it."
e4t56fn;ja1484;1535234013.0;"I'm of the belief that doing the things they need to do to monetize will kill their appeal and make them an also-ran.Everyone likes free/subsidized shit, especially broke ass young people."
e4tmx4j;yumble95;1535252046.0;"Not at their current price, or so I hope for the buyer."
e4zn129;5139492003792679;1535510688.0;"No there isn't. All publicly traded stock are non voting shares. "
e4t3ica;ClaymoreMine;1535231901.0;"Companies like SNAP and their major stakeholders can’t see what made them successful and are chasing short term profits and metrics. Technically Apple could take on snap and Instagram by interpreting the popular features into iMessage. "

e4tbx57;doogie88;1535241197.0;"Wife uses it, solid logic why it'll be successful!"
e4tci33;Gareth321;1535241766.0;"Don’t be a dick. Clearly I am describing their very sticky user base which is close to 200 million now. They are *daily* users. Don’t take my word for it. All of this is available in their quarterly reports."
e4tclp7;doogie88;1535241864.0;"They'll follow like sheep to something else though so that's irrelevant."

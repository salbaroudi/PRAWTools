e4uvmsv;biglocowcard;1535310942.0;"Don't short Apple."
e4ude8s;recommendmeapodcast;1535279797.0;"Shorting is always on margin. Sounds like you'd need at least $15k, but keep in mind as soon as your bets lose money you will be subject to a margin call. I'd recommend $20k so you can ride out some rough spots"
e4ux1mr;enginerd03;1535313708.0;"At least 30k.Your long and short positions on margin are not netting. "
e4w6rs7;thrdroc;1535362837.0;"This all depends on the volatility of each stock. $5,000 of IBM on margin should require $5,000 of assets in the account. I just check my brokerage account for short selling the AAPL. My brokerage would require assets of $5,000 to short sell $10,000 of AAPL. So all in it would be approximately $10,000 but a margin call could come quick if you barely had enough to cover the two transactions and either stock went poorly for you."

e4v50a5;lykosen11;1535324458.0;"So we should short it. Thanks for valuable input. "
e4vjp9d;missedthecue;1535339086.0;"This is not true. Margin accounts do not require $25k minimum"
e4vgbjc;IamDiggnified;1535335785.0;"Thanks Paul. Irrespective of account minimums policies... I’m thinking If I had $15k in @@@ it would allow me to buy $15 k of &&& on margin long or I would be able to short $30k  of &&&. So having $30k in @@@ should allow me to buy $15k of &&& long on margin and short $30k o &&& as well (I realize you can’t be long/short same stock). "
e4v9phd;kinnaq;1535329344.0;"You're right.  The companies are not the point.  The point is that someone who needs to ask basic questions about margin is thinking of dicking around with margin.RIP.Edit:  Once again, downvotes for trying to spare OP from pain later.  Not the first time, nor the last.  I'll keep at it. Hell, half the margin users on robinhood don't realize they can't just delete the app and hide when they owe RH 10k.  There are even assholes saying you aren't responsible for paying back margin debt, that somehow it's 'cost of business' for the broker.  WTAF?Goddamn people, you don't even have to make stupid calls to get totally fucked by margin.  We're in an insane bull run, and there are possible bubble triggers all around.  If you go long on margin with even the best stocks, you could be screwed.  If you short, the market can stay irrational.  Just remember that someone tried to warn you. "

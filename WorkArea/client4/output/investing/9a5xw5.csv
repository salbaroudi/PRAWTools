9a5xw5;FirstGalacticEmpire;1535222910.0;"Hi, I was wondering: Can an individual buy a lot of call options then buy shit tone of a stock to drive the stock price up? If so, do big financial institutions do this often? Or is it a fraud?"

e4t9ytd;arnoldfrend;1535239232.0;"If you drive the stock up by buying it, the increase in the price of the call option is about the same as how much you paid to drive the stock up. A proper pump and dump scheme also attracts other buyers. A: "I'll sell you my car for 1000 dollars."B: "I'll give you 10 dollars to keep that deal available to me a year from now. "A: "Deal."B: "I just went on craigslist and bought all the cars in the area for way over book. Anyone who wants to buy your car now would have to match my bid of 2000 dollars. The value of my 10 dollar contract just went up to 1000 dollars."A: "k"The scene plays out differently if B promises to *keep buying* at increased rates, thus drawing in other buyers. "

e4tf0gr;rainman_104;1535244306.0;"Usually calls don't move 1:1 with stock price.   As you pump up the price the call won't move as much.   Furthermore it's pretty hard to have enough capital to actually move a share price enough to profit both on shares and on the calls.It's better to just be an analyst and buy the calls before changing the rating.  "
e4u2p4m;Cyb0Ninja;1535268337.0;"It's rumored that there's a large group of financiers that do exactly the opposite of this all the time. (Tin foil hat time)I swear if you look at the L2s long enough you start seeing weird orders. Like random numbers of shares, but always ending in the same digits. For example an order will be like 537, 1037, 2237, 15037. No one buys chunks of shares like that unless they are YOLOing. And you'll see different size orders ending in the same digits within minutes of one another. Like the user placed the order then retracted it and then placed it again. I'm convinced this is one of the ways they signal each other without leaving a trail.."
e4t45zy;kiwimancy;1535232744.0;"It depends on your intentions. If you do it specifically on certain contracts to manipulate the price to profit off artificial movements, that's manipulation and illegal. Usually your trading this way would lose money, so you would need to carefully select the contracts and timing to make it work. If you do it because you want a certain type of exposure to the stock, it's legal."

e4t382m;WikiTextBot;1535231512.0;"**Pump and dump**"Pump and dump" (P&D) is a form of securities fraud  that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Once the operators of the scheme "dump" sell their overvalued shares, the price falls and investors lose their money. This is most common with small cap cryptocurrencies and very small corporations, i.e. "microcaps".***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

e4tzya2;WikiTextBot;1535265333.0;"**Market manipulation**Market manipulation is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation of the market and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a product, security, commodity or currency. Many forms of market manipulation are prohibited in most countries, in particular, it is prohibited in the United States under Section 9(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in the European Union under Article 12 of the Market Abuse Regulation, in Australia under Section 1041A of the Corporations Act 2001, and in Israel under Section 54(a) of the securities act of 1968. The Act defines market manipulation as transactions which create an artificial price or maintain an artificial price for a tradeable security. Market manipulation is also prohibited for wholesale electricity markets under Section 222 of the Federal Power Act and wholesale natural gas markets under Section 4A of the Natural Gas Act.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

e4t41dr;campelm;1535232582.0;"I thought they were pushing along that line.  If not pump and dump I'm sure it falls under some sort of market manipulation like ramping, but falling back to what I was really wanting to make with  my first post: don't ask reddit for legal advice."
e4t9ksi;greenfrog7;1535238829.0;"Reading OP as written, if all the trades (in the options or the underlying) are the product of real trades with actual 3rd party sellers, then the "strategy" seems legal enough. The problem is that often this idea that you will build volume and ride the price action higher after other participants follow your trade goes hand in hand with illegal actions like painting the tape, wash trading etc.Otherwise, you're just committing a pile of capital to a stock hoping that your confidence inspires others to confidence. (And walking the line between "get long, get loud" and pump and dump)Also there are a number of assumptions made about the other players in this scenario. Namely, that there is legitimate volume offered for you to buy, that you have more ammunition than those who would short the stock, and that whoever sold short the calls is passive in the underlying."

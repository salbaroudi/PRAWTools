9akpnq;matty1monopoly;1535360911.0;Why did BLV drop on 31 Jan 2018 just like SPY?
9akpnq;matty1monopoly;1535360911.0;"I'm currently looking for a safe bond fund. I've mostly picked BLV due to its low correlation to the stock market, specifically SPY. However I noticed on January 31st, it dropped just like the S&P 500 yet never recovered unlike the S&P.I'm looking for reasons. Here are a few conjectures of my own.1. Profit taking - The tax bill had just been passed a month earlier and people were selling their stocks (including bond etf's) as part of profit taking.2. Bonds exploded - Traders could tell this new tax bill is going to cost a trillion dollars of debt to fund. Yields on bonds had been pushed low for almost a decade due to Quantitative Easing (QE). With QE over and the government instituting a giant stimulus so late into a bull market, yields on bonds raised to help fund the skepticism on newly issued government debt. 3. Gov Debt vs. Corp Debt - With the new trillion dollar deficit, government debt at higher yields would be more attractive than riskier corporate debt. This leading to a squeeze in the corporate market having to pay for debt at a higher rate and for the government having to pay higher yields as well, leading to a less profitable future for companies and thus lower tax revenue.These are just 3 guesses. They are not definitive reasons. I'm open to hearing other ideas and would be extremely interested. Maybe it could be as simple as a government official saying that bond holders were going to take a haircut, causing the market to dive. Please share your ideas and views. "

e4x2m20;kiwimancy;1535409911.0;"Long term bonds trade mostly off of GDP growth and inflation. Higher inflation was reported around then and jolted the bond market a bit. Other things have helped keep prices down: rising deficits from the tax cut, higher cash rates, gradually accelerating QT, decent growth. But trade war concerns have contributed to pull back bond prices by about half the february drop.  Keep in mind, this is a pretty normal amount of movement for long term bonds. You will see plenty of volatility in them. But they should be mostly uncorrelated to stocks."

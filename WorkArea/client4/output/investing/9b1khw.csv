9b1khw;Wsn21;1535510722.0;"Just a quick question (that i should know)In an IRA, at retirement age, do i pay taxes only on the money i invested (and gains are tax free?) or do you pay taxes on everything totalLike my IRA has 10k ive put in... hypothetically if i dont deposit more and if i make and have a million $ at retirement in my IRA, do i pay taxes on the 10k or on the 1mil? Thanks!"

e4znhli;meepster17;1535511072.0;"If you have a traditional IRA, you will pay taxes on everything, since you didn't pay ANY tax when putting the money in.If you have a Roth IRA, you pay taxes up front and never again. So, using your example, you would pay taxes on your $10,000 and then none later when you retire. "
e4zo1x6;Wsn21;1535511537.0;"Thank ypu, just to clarify... I guess my question boils down to, in a traditional IRA, i DO pay taxes on my total gains?"
e4zo37x;meepster17;1535511567.0;"Yes you do."
e4zpsrj;DeeDee_Z;1535513016.0;">  pay taxes on my total gainsTotal gains, total contributions, total dividends.  None of it has been previously taxed."
e4zu1h1;Stellyx;1535516584.0;"Easy way to think about it is that you will pay taxes on any money you recieve that has not been taxed."
e4zt99q;Dill323;1535515921.0;"Stupid question: I see the advantage of the Roth IRA, but what is the advantage of an IRA if youâ€™re getting taxed on everything?  "
e50492y;jsf67;1535525640.0;"If you compare based on the cost of the contribution (rather than the size of the contribution) the results are remarkably similar because of the commutative law of multiplication.    In a pre-tax IRA your money first grows then the total is multiplied by {one minus tax rate}.  For a Roth, the money is first multiplied by {one minus tax rate} and then grows.  If the two tax rates are the same, the result is the same.  Either one is better than an ordinary account, which taxes the start the same way as for a Roth but then additionally taxes the growth.    One extra advantage of Roth is that when you are hitting the annual limit the equal cost comparison doesn't apply (Maybe $8K in a traditional IRA would work out as the same cost and better result than $5.5K in a Roth, but you can't contribute $8K).  "
e4zufvu;DeeDee_Z;1535516915.0;"**Deferring** taxes is also very popular with some people.  Me, for one!Also note: the taxes you save in the beginning are at your marginal tax rate.  If you were in the 25%* bracket when you earned those dollars, you saved $1250 on a $5000 contribution.    HOWEVER, when you have no other income and start taking IRA distributions, EVEN IF you are still in the 25% bracket, you're now paying 0% on some of your income, 10% on some of your income, and 25% ONLY on the part above its threshhold.SO, you still save money by paying with future dollars.*Pre-2018 tax rates used in example."
e50e13h;mbrasher1;1535535022.0;"There was an old blog post that pertains to this very topic. It is quite informative on the difference and the advantage of each different kind of tax-advantaged IRA.It is worth a read.https://thefinancebuff.com/case-against-roth-401k.html Bottom line is that for most people, the tax rate now is higher than the rate in retirement (unless you have a large pension, medical intern or future wealth ahead) it is better to take the deduction now."
e4ztz4s;Lumix3;1535516528.0;"traditional IRAs lower your income taxes immediately because you can deduct the money you put in on your tax returns.Traditional IRA = saves you money in the short term, costs more during retirementRoth IRA = costs more in the short term, saves money in retirement"

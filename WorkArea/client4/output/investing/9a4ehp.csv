9a4ehp;asml84;1535202332.0;"As far as I understand an option trade is not a deal between two uniquely identifiable parties. Rather, assignment on expiration is random. Do 100% of option sellers get called (short call) or assigned stock (short put) if an option expires in the money or is it possible that a seller gets lucky?"

e4st2mq;IncendiaryGames;1535210953.0;"The OCC will automatically exercise any option that is $0.01 in the money or more. There is still a chance that it may not be exercised but the investor would have to manually tell the OCC not to. One reason they may not want to exercise it is if it's so close to being worthless there is more overnight risk in movement of the underlying than what the option would be worth. "

e4tx4l2;bmwkbiker;1535262440.0;"If you're short a call that is more than a penny or two in the money. It will be assigned, assuming you have the stock, you just sold N x 100 shares. If you don't have the shares, you broker will buy them (for you) in the open market (without any regard for the price).Short puts, will be assigned and you just bought the stock at the strike. And will have to deal with any margin consequences the purchase creates.BTW this doesn't just apply to the options expiration date. Your short puts/calls can be assigned at any time (for "American" style options). The holder(excerciser) of the option, will be (somewhat) arbitrarily matched to the short sellers."
e4sosz1;EconomicHustle;1535203164.0;"I believe most people never exercise their right. Options are mostly just bought and sold when liquidity permits. One might have to caught up the cash if you have no one who wants your option to by. Depending on the amount in question you might want to front the cash. ðŸ˜‚"
e4tzmiu;asml84;1535264980.0;"For short calls, does my broker actually buy the stock upon assignment if I donâ€™t own them or does he open a short position?"
e4t4l07;doougle;1535233273.0;"We're talking about options that still exist at expiration.  The bought and sold ones are gone at that point.You did hit on the reason some people don't exercise even if the option expires in the money.  Either they don't have the money to buy/sell the shares or they don't want to take on the stock risk over the weekend."
e4v3a6c;Nettletooth;1535322535.0;"What happens is that when you are assigned on a short call, the short stock appears out of thin air.It is a naked short, no borrow/locate needed.  The shares are basically an accounting artifact of the system until option assignment settles the next day, at which point your broker needs to either locate the shares if you want to stay short, or you need to buy the shares to cover.  If you are in a bad risk position after assignment, they may force you to buy to cover at open.  Otherwise, they will give you a day to figure it out.There are a few creative ways to manipulate this process to get and stay short without borrowing stock, but it causes failure to deliver issues on the broker end and will eventually get their attention in a bad way."
e4u051g;bmwkbiker;1535265536.0;"Don't know I'd guess the former. If you really want the answer ask your brokerage firm."

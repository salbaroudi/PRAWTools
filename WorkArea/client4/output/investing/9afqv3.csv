9afqv3;RTiger;1535321070.0;"One anecdotal indicator of a market top is that the stock market becomes a topic of conversation at many casual gatherings.So what is it like at your local gym, coffee shop, church, office? Are newbies asking about the market? Are people bragging about their huge profits? Or are the topics mostly non-financial? "

e4v32pn;DillonSyp;1535322294.0;"I almost never hear it come up in conversation personally "
e4v3ava;Strix780;1535322558.0;"Nobody talks much about the markets at my work.  Sometimes we'll talk about pension stuff, or salary negotiations, but we never talk about our own investments."
e4v4txf;ThePerzzh;1535324264.0;"Most of the people I’m friends with aren’t too talkative with investments. Although for some reason they do frequently tell me “I want to find an investment with no risk and at least a 10% return.”To which I reply, “Me too!”"
e4va4b0;whoknowzz;1535329763.0;"When anything comes up it’s an automatic red flag and these people usually don’t know anything.Examples include HMNY, GTAT (now bankrupt), marijuana stocks, and often small tech companies. TSLA is also popular but personally not a big fan.Edit: a word"
e4vbdr1;motterpaul;1535330964.0;"I agree this is a good anecdotal indicator and I also agree that most people are NOT following the stock market right now. One sign of a top is when people start talking about individual stocks - but these days most people are in ETFs or funds, and not stock pickers. Especially since the "crash" last February talk has really dried up, even though the S&P has finally recovered.The "close to being" inverted yield curve has a lot of people talking about a market top and a recession, but it isn't happening yet. The Fed is likely to raise rates again in Sept, but most analysts are saying that is already "baked in". The question is how far will the Fed go? If they keep raising and bonds look more attractive than stocks then you could see a market drop.But the conversation is about equal on both sides (up or down) - def not a "market top indicator" right now."
e4v87mz;RTiger;1535327814.0;"I can echo some of the replies. Stock market talk is minimal, even with other people that are active investors. So this indicator is in the bullish column.At many market tops, the stock market becomes the first or second topic at many social gatherings. Watch for it. While anecdotal, it is a useful indicator. "
e4v8s3w;RonDooberTron65;1535328397.0;"I have a couple co-workers I talk stocks with, but it's pretty steady conversation and doesnt indicate what the OP is referencing. I got one Co-worker who is hell bent on making millions on penny stocks, he also buys lottery tickets every drawing, pretty funny actually.I will say that the best spot that I have found to check market hype is the Yahoo Finance Conversation Boards for the various stocks. You can really get a good reading on how hyped a stock is. Check AMD board right now, people are going bonkers talking about selling property to purchase AMD shares. I'm invested in AMD by the way. "
e4vtd9w;GreyscaleSunset;1535348383.0;"Worth considering the political biases of your gatherings as people struggle to separate their politics from realistic market expectations (I gave up explaining inflation's effect on cash-savings and time-in-the-market).I am physically building something stock-related so it might come up more often than it would for you guys, but no one is getting hysterical or over-invested. I coached someone through some market options but he opted for a pretty safe ISA. There isn't much opportunity for individual stock-picking in the UK."
e4w3efs;tondo22;1535359185.0;"On a somewhat related note. I sold my Bitcoin when I heard my mom talk about it. Might of been the best market timing ill ever pull off. "
e4xf3zn;astearns31;1535420987.0;"I talk shop with some folks at work. One guy yolo's options around earnings reports and surprising has done well with it (unless he is lying to me which I wouldn't be surprised). Another fellow is really into the market. He has financial model's that he has written up. He's a great person to trade ideas with.Last year, I had a ton of people asking me about bitcoin. They know I like to pay attention to the markets so assumed I knew about bitcoin. I know next to nothing or care about bitcoin so I could never talk with them. But once you have admins, who have no financial knowledge whatsoever asking me about it, I knew it was a shoe shine moment. "

I thought gopro was about to revolutionise the way we watch videos maybe before there time and poor product quality with drone. Edit-no one listens. Even with offer of free share via robinhood and half my free share if it is more in value. I don't get it! Offered it to gamblers and all sorts."
e4vspva;GreyscaleSunset;1535347736.0;"🤣"
e4vtr6h;GreyscaleSunset;1535348778.0;"These people often laugh at you as well if they make big profits. Jason Zweig gave a good simile - they're like people who drive double the speed limit and tell you how much more time they're saving than you."
e4vfqi1;zachmoe;1535335210.0;">If they keep raising4% is all it will need to be to cause a sharp decline in prices."

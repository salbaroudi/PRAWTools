9a3jud;wonder2wander;1535193784.0;"My current employer has Fidelity as the 401k provider. From last 2 years I have had 100% of my 401k amount invested in FXSIX.. In the past few days I found I can choose Fidelity Freedom 2055 Fund as an alternative. This fund has a good mix of US + international funds and about 10% in bonds.. Fxsix has way lower ER and better performance. Please let me know what y'all think.. Edit: it's FXSIX"

e4sjsw2;skaadrider;1535196401.0;"The idea behind target date funds is that the fund manager will gradually shift the portfolio from stock-heavy to bond-heavy as the target date approaches. Ultimately, it’s supposed to automate one more step in the investment process.As to whether they actually do a good job or not, I cannot say."
e4tgycu;AlNOKEA;1535246201.0;"The main advantage of the target date fund is you can set it and forget it. No worries, no hassle. No need to rebalance at different stages in your life as it is all done for you.The disadvantages are that even though you’re young they keep some of your capital in bonds (and will continue to increase it as you get older, obviously), which can gimp a portfolio that has 30-40 years to retirement. Also, expense ratios tend to be much higher as opposed to a standard s&p index. You’re basically paying them a significant chunk of change to rebalance your portfolio for you, which I feel can be easily done yourself. The main benefit of doing it yourself is that you can tailor the amount of risk that suits youRight now I’m 90-10 in SWPPX and SWISX. My ER is 0.03 and 0.06 respectively. Compared to Fidelity 2055 ER of 0.75. But if we were comparing the two you mentioned, yes I’d hands down go with the Fidelity 2055."
e4vk3pq;spankasmurf;1535339467.0;"so you are almost 40 yrs from retirement?  making you under 30?  hmmm....the difference in expense ratios may not seem like much but over that amount of time, you may want to run some hypothetical numbers...be sure to read up on the allocation changes in the target fund, they may be too conservative for some.  Good Luck and good on you for saving when you are young, I wish I did."
e4t57k7;kiwimancy;1535234051.0;"FSISX is just cash. Did you mean FUSVX or something?  The biggest benefit of a target date fund is that investors don't have to know anything to invest in it. You just put everything in it and you'll be diversified and allocated in a standard way. You won't be tempted to switch out of assets that have been underperforming recently (but might be at a better value now).  FUSVX on the other hand has a bunch of high quality companies. It won't always outperform international stocks or bonds but it has quite done well in the past century."

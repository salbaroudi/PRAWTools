99oq81;wirsteve;1535069670.0;"Pretty obvious what it is now, "Cloud Computing". Companies have to "move to the cloud". Some companies don't even have directors of IT on staff, they just hire a consulting firm to move them to the "cloud" but they don't know what it is.Let's say 5 years ago* Everything was hosted locally or with an IT provider. Citrix for example was popular* The number of apps in iOS app store and Play store have tripled - mobile is king* Businesses slowly started to look at technology as a need and not as a luxuryNow * SaaS is king, hosting data in Azure, AWS or Google's data centers is popular* Citrix/VMware is still used but in a different capacity* You need a mobile app to pair with your website / company to be looked at seriously* eCommerce has been changed dramatically with Square & competitorsSo what's next?* Edge networking?* A boom in security spending?* Machine learning?* Blockchain?* VR & AR?* Internet of Things?* Smart kitchens?* 3D Printing?We all know deep down, whatever the infrastructure is now, and whatever is popular now won't be in 2023. I'd love to hear what you guys think. Obviously my list isn't what you have to pick from. It's just some things that I think could potentially take off."

e4pbecr;el_tacomonkey;1535072527.0;"I work in tech/data. It’s machine learning for sure. In fact, machine learning is currently the big thing now that most aggressive companies have already moved to the cloud. The two go hand-in-hand since the cloud gives you unlimited storage and compute power and those are the two resources you need to do machine learning successfully (other than data scientists)However, I don’t think too many people are going to make money with machine learning directly, they’re going to use it to build products and services that help their businesses.

e4p9lg5;orfane;1535071057.0;"There is some interesting convergence happening now between Tech and Medicine, which will only continue in the future. Tele-medicine is going to keep growing, as will new ways of digitizing and handling medical records and analysis.Along those same lines, tech is becoming more viable for rehab and other medical uses, especially VR. As the population gets older I expect that to become more and more relied upon as well. Examples, an eye implant may allow a person to see again, but they first need to be trained on how to use it. Or a person may have a stroke and need physical therapy to move an arm again. Both scenarios can be improved with a VR setup. So tech wise there is a lot of room for VR companies to move into medicine while most aren't looking that way, and there will be new biotech companies setup to make these new therapies available"
e4p9026;Hajduk85;1535070567.0;"Augmented reality for sure. Everyone's been screaming about VR for entertainment, but I think the business impact of AR will be much, much greater. For example, I saw a video of new GE technicians in training doing repairs of industrial equipment with a paper manual compared to an AR setup and the AR trainees shaved 40% off their time"
e4p8pun;pm_me_construction;1535070333.0;"I think AR will be a big thing in the future. Microsoft is investing pretty heavily in it as well. I think the Google Glass project was well ahead of its time and eventually a headset will replace our smartphones.I think VR will also have a place but I don’t see it being as practically useful as AR."
e4pn8qz;babbocom;1535082172.0;"I'm going off the beaten path and am throwing out an oddball.&#x200B;The next big thing in tech is the convergence of communication technology (Slack, video conferencing, screen sharing, online meetings, etc.) and the sharing economy (WeWork, AirBnB, etc.) as relates to the corporation.* Multi-site collaboration is getting easier all the time.* Growing acceptance of remote work.* Reduced need for all employees to be in one gigantic HQ or big regional office.* Desire to avoid punitive, targeted local taxes (i.e. Seattle attempted soaking of Amazon)* Increased variability in team size and duration (i.e. freelancers/consultants that augment a team for a project and then move on to something else)I see more and more teams, small companies, and solo acts working in a temporary shared space (WeWork) or having key members working remotely. It would not surprise me if this trend continued. The extreme version of this would be a huge company going virtual, which is admittedly pretty far-fetched.&#x200B;With that being said, I don't know where people would settle. If I can work anywhere, would I go to a "paradise location" like Fiji? Would I go to a rural, LCOL area to maximize the advantage of my pay? Would I move to a HCOL city because I need the amenities my job doesn't provide? Would a company keep executives in a HCOL and offer remote work to individual contributors in order to lower SG&A?"

Each is somewhere alone the hype cycle. How many of those are tractable investable concepts, that’s tbd. My personal feeling is that this mode of thinking misses the real opportunity arising from tech. Tech itself could freeze as is and there would still be a generation of work in pushing out existing technologies to other non information industries. That has huge productivity potential. So the question I guess is identifying the companies that are good USERS and COST EFFECTIVE BUYERS of technology and try to capture the beneficial effects of the wholesale digitization of existing industries.

e4pe347;BenevolentCheese;1535074713.0;">You need a mobile app to pair with your website / company to be looked at seriouslyThis isn't really true at all, at least outside of tech startups. In fact, most companies are moving *away* from apps. Unless there is transaction potential, companies are prioritizing mobile web, and rightfully so: apps even from really big brands have terrible user numbers. Most people don't want to download an app for something they only use once a month and for which the mobile website retains 90%+ of the functionality of the app."

e4ptkwz;jonhuang;1535087521.0;"We will soon hit a tipping point (or have already hit it) where machines have better pattern recognition than humans. Current neural nets are about the sophistication of a blob of preprocessing tissue. I'm very skeptical about true AI, but what's been done already is amazing and stepping a bit beyond that will be huge. The funny part is that the hardware and software for AI may have outpaced social acceptance. Which means that a flip could be very fast. I read that one problem with Watson Health was that hospitals didn't want to pay additional for a cancer diagnosis robot that generally agreed with the doctor anyway. What if they just skip paying the doctor instead. The stock trader. The inventory control specialist. The air traffic controller. Terrible idea right now, but it's coming. Along that, smart speakers are going to be big, IMHO. Once you get used it it, not having one around is like not having a cell phone nearby. (Though I don't think Sonos is competitive with Amazon or Google)I don't think AR/VR are going to be big soon, honestly. I have a Rift, I've used a Vive, Google Glass, holo lens, daydream, gearVR, and have developed both VR and AR apps. It's clunky, uncomfortable, expensive, and dorky. I think you'll see everyone with a smart speaker/headphones and a smartwatch before face computers take off outside of specialized applications or hardcore gaming. Blockchain is even less mainstream. 10 years, billions of dollars spent on development, and there's not one non-speculative use case that has more than 1000 people using it on a daily basis. (exception: semi-private blockchains that replace databases in business facing applications).At some point we'll get a hang of this DNA thing and  will be able to code in it like we code in computer languages. Customized treatments, special purpose organisms, that sort of thing. Probably a long time away.Ah, and I think Chinese companies will probably take over quite a few high tech industries at some point. Flagship telephones, for example. "

e4q5p1d;RavenMute;1535099556.0;"Isn't the first rule of making money "don't crowdsource your investing advice"?Seriously though, I'll chime in on some of the infrastructure side of tech. (Disclaimer: I'm a sysadmin but these are all opinions and not financial advice)The swap from on-prem hosting to cloud hosting has swung hard towards the cloud, but security concerns are likely to bring at least some of that back towards being run by businesses on site. More likely we're moving towards a more balanced model of cloud and on-prem solutions.SaaS is making bank, but there's the start of some backlash against it now. User data is suddenly a sensitive subject and making sure you control that flow of metadata (if not to protect it for your consumers then to make sure it retains value by being only available through your company) becomes a factor in assessing SaaS based solutions.IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service, meaning AWS/Azure/etc.) will continue to improve and become more readily available a lower price point - all that does is expand adoption of their cloud platforms, it doesn't really end up changing the needs of businesses to have some on-prem components to their infrastructure. The next console generation will probably be the last one to run locally - everything related to video games is starting on their development plans to run cloud-based and streaming services. This, if nothing else, will (hopefully) provide the necessary momentum to improve bandwidth across large parts of the US. How this shakes up the services and video games market (especially as relates to consoles vs. PC adoption) is kind of up in the air until we see the state of infrastructure and speeds at the point where this launches. Something to keep an eye on though.Machine learning, 3D printing, and VR/AR are not high on my list of things to watch. In those industries I think there needs to be a breakthrough of some kind before they become mainstream moneymakers, and tech breakthroughs are hard to predict.IoT, Smart Kitchens/homes, and Blockchain are all too gimmicky to really drive large-scale investment. They will face security scrutiny in the future for sure as right now they are pretty terrible at that side of the equation. The money-making opportunities here are (IMO) very limited unless you're really good at timing shorts (and I'm not).The big tech investment that I think will sneak up on everyone is asteroid mining and permanent space colonization. People still have sci-fi tinted glasses on and see it as a pipe dream or being farther off than it likely is - it falls into the same mental category as fusion power ("always 10 years away") when the private enterprise push towards actual deliverables is pretty strong. Whether or not they're able to actually deliver is a different question, but I think the attention that SpaceX gets shows a healthy appetite in investors for that kind of "grand" project.Genetic testing is also going to be huge going forward (unless legislated against) for insurance agencies. If you thought pre-existing conditions were bad wait until they try to nail you for your risk of prostate/breast cancer due to genetic markers.One big prediction I have is that digital security will have a 9/11-like moment where something goes horribly wrong - maybe an attack or possibly a confluence of events that all converge on the wrong place at the wrong time. **If** that happens we **might** see a massive backlash against certain types of technology related to whatever industry go hit - my bets are on healthcare, banking, or utilities getting nailed.This went on a lot longer than I expected, take all of it with a healthy grain of salt."

The next thing from a conqueror standpoint is Mars. And all the tech needed. VR and AR is not going to take hold in everyday life for commoners. The “download our app”  thing is really viscious. It has reached past a boiling point. Today, here in Denmark, if you want to buy a monthly pass to public tranapprt, your ONLY option is through an app that you have to show. This means you have to carry a phone and a charger with you at all times. And in practice, battery life decides if you have a ticket or not. The only other option is an electronic card which you have to hold up to a pole with blue light each time you enter and exit. This is not only cumbersome as hell. It allows the national transport services to raise prices based on demand, so that rush hour gets more expensive in the freaking train. Or they can just disable someone's card and suddenly they can’t use public transportation. The loophole is that you can still buy physical pendler passes in very few spots and only if under 20 miles.

What we saw was the failure of several companies to make it a one-for-all technology where people of all walks of life can use it. The truth? The only people that could bring use out of it have been people with the engineering and background knowledge to support creations made for 3D printing. Your average consumer will never understand or use tolerances, design practices, or common engineering knowledge in their solutions and creations.Case in point: As an engineer, I designed and printed a case for an electronics enclosure to use and made sure to account for all issues with variations in mounting structure and cable clearances. The crap I saw on Thingiverse for similar solutions? Crap. Designed by people just toying around with Autodesk Fusion 360 or OnShape and not understanding that even the 3D printed objects they made end up having variation from what they designed.Furthermore, manufacturing hasn't even begun to regularly use 3D printing yet in order to eliminate material waste, solve common design issues, and solve problems caused by conventional manufacturing processes. While it may be just another manufacturing process, it's one that can be applied across a broad range of industries similar to that of the role of robotics in many manufacturing plants. The first company that figures out how to make a series of common 3D printer platforms that can tackle the vast majority of current manufacturing hurdles will definitely be something worth investing in."

These types of systems will only get more advanced and include many more products. For example, it will be extended into traditional rental housing and other informal activities. Take for example if you need some sort of tool. Why go to home depot to rent the tool when you can rent it from your neighbor for less? People will create micro-business within these types of systems.Rise of high-density living accommodations: As cities become more dense, new building methods or software will be created to allow for higher-density living.Transportation: Electric cars, shared bikes, scooters and similar systems will be created. People will abandon the idea of actually owning a bike, scooter or car, especially in big cities.Ubiquitous wifi networks: As wifi networks expand most major cities will have wifi accessible to the entire city almost everywhere. Technology will be created to allow everyone to share their existing broadband networks. It might be created by cities, telecom companies or private organizations. The creation of these networks will also give rise to smart cities and more efficient operation of the city.Farming: Robots and drones will help to farm crops. Drones will analyze soil conditions, moisture levels and disease while other drones could be used to precision pest control or similar. Robots would harvest crops which are traditionally harvested by hand.Renewable energy: Lithium-ion battery demand will expand and home battery systems will rapidly expand. New battery technology might also be commercialized. Micro grid systems will become more common. Medical: robotic surgery will increase rapidly. AI/ML/AR: Everyone already knows about this one but the key is know WHERE or WHAT it will be applied to. New companies will be created is the key. The companies that will make money in this area aren't the big tech companies like google, amazon or Microsoft. It will be companies that learn how to USE the technology to make great products or services.Drones: Similar to AI/ML/AR in the sense that the key here is to look at companies that are using drones to create products or services. Drone package delivery, drones that deliver emergency provisions during disasters, surveillance/security applications and so on.Education: Education will become commoditized in the sense that the actual information you learn from school/university will be cheap and openly accessible. The quality of these systems will increase dramatically and will mostly be online. Technology will be used to dramatically enhance how students learn. Most people will learn online in a self-study type fashion and these systems will expand globally to teach every person in the world. Systems will be created to verify and assess student knowledge which will eventually lead to the replacement of traditional university degrees. Rise of the pure digital economy: Performing cross boarder trade will become easier as people adopt uniform forms of payment systems. Most likely some form of cryptocurrency will be created to settle international trades. Places that have unstable currencies (like Venezuela) will flock to using some sort of crytocurrency. The trade in digital services, knowledge work and other forms of trade will mostly be conducted in a global marketplace. People can openly trade and exchange labor or services in this system. All trade in the system will be cryptocurrency based which allow bypassing currency controls and the need for currency exchange. Reputation systems will be implemented to ensure that only the most honest are rewarded. Traditional labor regulations will be obsolete in this system since everything will be pure free market system. Employers will be able to hire people from anywhere in the world."

As a programmer for over 20 years I am most excited about decentralized platforms, AI/ML/DL, and AR. Decentralized platforms are going to cause a "tokenization" of everything. Most people don't realize this stuff goes far beyond just digital gold or money. Securities, commodities, supply chains, loans, insurance, legal/medical/accounting records and much much more will run through these systems. They are global, immutable, secure, convenient, cheap and can be accessed at any time without any nation-state, organization or individual having the power to corrupt the system or shut it down. These networks provide a method to cut-out the middle-man in many types of transactions and reduce the fee to the lowest possible amount between two or more parties (and in some situations no fee).AI is simply going to get so advanced it will be scary. For example, after 2023 we will probably start to see conversational level AI that's on par or better than something like the Star Trek computer. It will understand not just the request but also have a deep understanding of the context of the conversation along with a memory of past discussions. Self-driving cars and trucks will obviously be more of a reality around that time (probably still in testing phase but not a rarity to see on the road here and there). Cameras are going to become creepy in terms of object recognition and even limited forms of context understanding. For example, your outside house camera might understand enough context to tell you what time your mailman dropped off the mail and whether or not your neighbors across the street are home.This won't be popular to say but I think Apple is going to launch AR glasses between 2020 to 2023 and they'll probably quickly become the industry leader in the space. They have a built-in customer base that will certainly buy millions of units, even if they are expensive. They have a developer ecosystem that will be highly familiar with their ARKit when the time arrives. They have solid product design skills, their own chips/hardware, and the internal capability to create a solid set of built-in software atop an OS stack that already can handle low-power graphically intense applications."

e4q43w2;slayemin;1535097889.0;"I started my own VR company because I believe VR is going to be the next future of tech and I want to be a part of building that future. It's looking pretty good as far as adoption curves go. We're still in the "Early Adopter" phase with the tech being lead by the gaming industry. Historically speaking, the gaming industry has been what drives a lot of technological adoption -- gamers are constantly pushing Intel and NVidia to make faster and better hardware, not enterprise companies.   The VR market is growing at a good clip. 3 million PSVR headsets have been sold. Oculus and HTC have done quite well. I visited Frys Electronics and asked a sales associate how they're doing with the HTC Vive sales, and he said that as soon as they get new hardware on stock on sundays, they immediately sell out, and this was a few months ago. The US gaming market is pretty eager for VR hardware and the content side is slowly starting to grow. I think it's safe to say that VR is here to stay and the market will be growing. VR isn't just a north american market either, it's actually even a bigger market in China. So, any VR strategies a company pursues will need to be looking at international markets rather than just local markets, and heavily consider localizing their content.VR is new. It's a new form of media which most people haven't quite grasped yet. Even VR designers don't quite know or understand how to use the full potential of the media. To make a comparison to television, we're in the early black and white era of TV programs.   VR still has a few rough spots to iron out, most notably artificial locomotion, motion sickness, the physicality of the experiences (people get tired faster when they have to stand and move around), and the paradigm shift in design approaches. I'm confident these issues will gradually be overcome with successive iterations of hardware and software tech. VR is going to be the last medium and it's going to fundamentally change the way people experience the world, interact with each other, learn, and entertain themselves.As far as investment goes, most of the major venture capitalists are staying away from funding VR content. They're more interested in funding platforms, whether its software or hardware platforms. I personally believe this is a short sighted mistake because all of the hardware and platforms are just expensive dust collectors without engaging content to go with it. VC's stay away from VR content creation companies because it's historically more risky (I produce VR content and have pitched to VC's). For now, the VR content ecosystem is mostly small companies and indie studios and a lot of the larger AAA gaming companies are starting to dip their toes into the water with small projects and ports of existing IP, but mostly are waiting for the market to mature before they start investing tens of millions into producing VR content.Gaming isn't just the only application for VR, though it tends to get the lions share of the attention due to being the tip of the spear in terms of early adopters. This is inherently and interactive media format which can be used for visualization, education, training programs, simulations, travel, and a few other industries. The architecture industry is rapidly shifting all of their arch viz to VR and it lets them iterate faster on concepts and helps their clients see and make changes of a building mock up. It's interesting to see how other industries unrelated to gaming are adopting VR technology into their existing workflows.I personally think AR is far away from becoming viable, but there are some interesting business use cases coming out. Boeing has a small AR team who has been working with the hololens to produce a concept app which lets mechanics read documentation on aircraft hardware as they're fixing it. This helps mechanics do faster and more effective repairs, even if they're not specialized experts (think of an aircraft mechanic in Dubai trying to diagnose and fix an aircraft problem). The current version of Hololens may not be deployed across the enterprises, but large companies like Boeing are standing up small teams to explore this space and its practical applications. I would expect AR to realistically be about 5-10 years away from broad adoption and feasibility, regardless of what the marketing hype machines of Magic Leap and Microsoft would have you believe. AR has bigger wrinkles to iron out than VR does.  The interesting think about VR is that if a head mounted display system decides to put pass through cameras on the headsets, the VR headset can easily be adapted to become an AR device, with all of the benefits of VR tech being layered onto AR. I think the HTC Vive Pro comes with two cameras which can be used as pass through cameras, but I've yet to see any content creators make full use of them. It's worth noting because this can easily turn existing VR platforms into direct competitors against AR platforms. The main advantage AR currently has is the reduced form factor, but over time I would expect that to change and to see the VR and AR sectors to eventually merge such that a headset can switch between AR & VR modes at the push of a button.  The only other tech sector I think worth looking at seriously is artificial intelligence. I think machine learning is both under rated by the general population, and over rated by the tech industry by treating it as a silver bullet to every problem. The tech industry tends to oversimplify big problems by thinking that ML can just be trained and applied to anything, and that foolish assumption creates hilarious and scary problems. Machine Learning, like all other AI systems, needs to be treated as an expert system built and trained by subject matter experts, and then when it's deployed into the field, it needs rigorous QA to validate its performance/outputs. Currently, engineers deploy ML to various industries and assume it's going to just work perfectly, not questioning if it's functioning properly to serve human needs correctly. The other big problem with ML and neuroscience in general, is that we just don't have a very good model for how actual intelligence works and what it is. The artificial neural networks we're using are treated mostly like mystery black boxes and they've been heavily tweaked to get the results we're looking for, but none of this is modeled after a strong intelligence model. There's going to be a lot of research and development required to get there, and it's going to require a joint multi-disciplinary effort between computer scientists, neuro scientists, biologists, philosophers, and ethicists. But, once we have a general artificial intelligence which is capable of learning and adapting to anything, I think that's going to be a fundamental world changer which is going to obsolete every current world economic system."

When you give a simple voice command for some purchase (not restricted to travel) what price do you get?For travel, since you gave it as your example, hotel bookings, plane tickets, train tickets, etc are not commoditized enough for there to be "a price".  There are many prices.  The price you see depends on what web site you go to and even what click path you took to get to that web site.  And people apparently have a huge appetite for web sites they can browse to find travel deals.  There's a ridiculous number of travel search sites, many of them just aggregating the others, and new ones seem to be popping up all the time.  People don't just go book and pay for a trip, they sort of stalk their hotels and routes of choice for a while, maybe set up some alerts, and buy when they think they're getting a good deal.Travel aside, there are plenty of things sold just within Amazon that have multiple listings at different prices or packaging combinations.  If you care about how much you are spending (and most people do) most things are not as simple as "Alexa, buy some X" - even if you bought X before because the price of that particular listing could easily have changed (which btw is a problem that plagues Subscribe and Save, where the listing you subscribe to has a price change but there are other listings of the same product which did not).What I think you are referring to is a scenario where users put a HUGE amount of pricing trust into whatever voice input they are speaking to.  And this is likely to be a single company, based on what phone or smart speaker or some other thing you have.I think most people are more price sensitive than that for almost everything they buy.That said, for situations where prices are fixed and well known such as ordering fast food it would be great to just rattle off a detailed order via voice and have it perfectly executed."

AR crosses over into VR at a point due to needing to simulate a remote environment; i.e. you are simulating environments you don't have real time data on; in other words, you are generating a virtual environment in order to move beyond that wall and "see" what's beyond that wall.AR is based in reality, so it's easier to imagine it's potential use cases for most people, because it's more relatable spatially (that virtual object is in this exact place in the room)VR is a bit more abstract tech than AR, due to not being limited by the physical environment.That cubicle sized space is still a cubicle sized space with AR and would need to be transformed into a virtual space to make it anything more.Probably not my best explanation, but hopefully it starts to illustrate the value of both that many seem to miss.

Their most important feature is that they're already up there.Without some kind of material science breakthrough that would allow for a space elevator the cost per kilogram to get something into orbit will stay high enough to incentivize private entities to fill in that niche of mining and refining operations and then selling that material to anyone running operations in space - which will probably remain heavily invested in by governments if for no other reason than the military stalemate it maintains.From there it becomes possible to grow an entirely new economy in orbit - and that's a juicy target for private entities to aim for.But the whole system - mining, refining, and building in space - becomes a feedback loop that grows itself once it gets started.

There’s an insane amount of friction and inefficiency in money transmission, particularly across borders. A universal digital currency solves that problem better than anything else. It theoretically solves a major problem and inefficiency in the global marketplace, it just can’t practically solve it yet because scalability, usability and ubiquity aren’t quite there yet. Give it another 10, maybe 20 years or so to improve and it’ll reach a point of no return where you won’t be able to do international business without it. In the same sense that trying to run an international business without using email is completely impractical at this point. Simply because the people who use it will outcompete those who don’t, even if they don’t hold on to it. Plain and simple it will facilitate the communication of value and money. It needs to be a universal standard and ubiquitous to achieve that, and its already painfully obvious what that standard will be, the ubiquity part is still yet to come. That’s what makes it the *next* big thing and relevant to the OP. And I am very specifically singling out bitcoin here.

The media and many prominent commentators in it are pretty terrible and confusing ML, AI, Data Mining, Computer Vision, Expert Systems, Robotics, Autonomous Systems and a variety of other related fields or specializations.There's a lot of additional theory to solve computer vision problems even though ML is used extensively to solve some of them.  Likewise AI is much more focused on actually making intelligent agents that can make decisions based on data and particularly limited data or situations where finding optimal solutions is impossible.  Some higher problems are things like planning, which is actually deciding what a system should do given the data it has available to achieve some goal.Something like robotics is going to use ML, computer vision and AI in an applied fashion and has a lot of focus probabilistic estimation techniques.In general you should have a good foundation in statistics, linear algebra and multivariable calculus before approaching a lot of the theory.

Plants take carbon dioxide in the air and water from the environment and transform it into carbohydrates (and the oxygen that we breath!). This process takes many steps, but the first step involves the protein, rubisco. Proteins can only work so fast in a set of conditions. For example, usually proteins can work a little faster if you increase the concentration of starting materials. One way we've increased the yields from plants is by making them use nitrogen more efficiently. We initially did this by dumping fertilizer (nitrogen compounds) on them. As we advanced, we used selective breeding techniques and genetic engineering to breed strains that were more efficient with nitrogen. This is just one example, there are more. That overarching point is that we can only optimize growing conditions and nutrient efficiency so much. The proteins in cells can only work so hard!Think of yourself. You can sleep better, have an extra cup of coffee in the morning, get a new desk at work, etc., but there is no way you could write a 1000 page novel in a day! You can only do so much work in a day, no matter how optimal your conditions are. Eventually, we will run into the limits of the proteins within plant cells, however there are scientists around the work trying to design more efficient versions of these proteins, so we can keep increasing crop yields!

The speaker suggested possibly selecting a bunch of them at random to control against a certain number of other 'blocks'. E.g.

Technology A took several minutes to initiate through a website and required a ton of identifying information of the vendor. It took a whole lot of typing and validation. It also cost me $50 to send a $1000 payment and took several days to clear, and the vendor also needed to pay an exchange fee.Technology B took me less than a minute to scan a QR code that already contained the address and invoice amount, initial notification of payment was received in under a second, final clearance took 20 minutes, and it cost me 3 cents to send $15000.They would have started packing the hardware moments after I clicked the send button with Technology B, and would have shipped it as soon as it cleared. It would have been in fedex’s hands within an hour, on a plane by night and in my hands by morning. I still needed to wait days for technology A to go through.

e4raj5z;rageingnonsense;1535153521.0;"If I could turn back the hands of time to last year, I would have bought NVidia in addition to AMD. Not just because it soared, but because it just makes sense. AMD couldn;t fight on two fronts with their resrouces, so they treaded water with their GPU division (just keeping up), and put most of their effort into their CPU division (specifically their server division). This means that NVidia will maintain a clear edge for the next few years at least (in the GPU space). I think NVidia is priced in though; too late to buy in (for me).The reason you think of AMD as inferior is partly due to Intel marketing, and partly due to AMD having a bad 5 - 10 years of processor design that lagged Intel. Back in the dot-com bubble era, AMD made the best chips; the Athlon. They were just better than Pentiums. My first few builds were AMD builds. My last build (about 8 years ago) was my first Intel build ever, because I could no longer justify an AMD chip. My next build will be, without a doubt, AMD.Intel and AMD have been an a 4 decades long dance, where Intel is better than AMD, and AMD is better than Intel. It ebbs and flows. Right now AMD is *killing* it. Interestingly though, they are reliant on eachother. AMD licensees x86 from Intel; that's how they are able to make the chips. Intel has to oblige though, because Intel licenses uses AMD's 64bit technology (Intel simply could not get this to work). There is evidence of this in your computer; if you use windows, you will undoubtedly find an AMD_64 reference somewhere.The most exciting thing about AMD though is that they offer a server chip with more cores, more PCI lanes (and you want PCI lanes for those GPUs that machine learning uses), a smaller server footprint (more servers per square foot in the data center) for a cheaper price. At this point, it is a no brainer for anyone in charge of a data center to go AMD. So these ML datacenters should have AMD servers, and NVidia GPUs for a while."

To use a good example, there's a business I know that's starting up looking to focus on utilizing blockchain to handle all of the paperwork and mess that comes with buying/selling a house. Everytime something is updated in the house buying/selling process, the token gets updated with the appropriate information and there's a clear historical list of changes to the token. While that has value to those involved in the buying/selling process, it really doesn't have any value to those that are not. It's just being used as a secure storage technology.Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency really has done a disservice to the block chain technology underneath by getting people to focus too much on the currency part and not enough on it being a massive ledger/Excel Sheet.> I disagree that one company/person can “own” a blockchain network and call them selves distributed still.Sure. For this example I'll make a few things up, but it's all to show you what I'm talking about. Let's say Google was the company I was referencing before and they want to get into the home title management business of facilitating the buying and selling of a house. They've got hundreds upon hundreds of servers around the globe and have the resources available to do this.So let's say they throw this "House" blockchain technology on 2000 of their servers. A malicious actor would have to find 1001 of those servers and break their encryption to modify that token without the appropriate keys. Changing fewer will allow the blockchain to "ignore" the malicious change because there's at least 50%+1 (1001) servers that say otherwise. *This is the power of distribution, not among people but among servers.* The technology still works regardless if one entity owns those 2000 servers or if those 2000 servers are owned by 2000 different people. The whole issue about "distribution among people" is explicitly concerning cryptocurrency and mining, as mining is the way cryptocurrency rewards users that use their resources to keep that cryptocurrency's blockchain up and that can be manipulated to reward large users that take up more and more of the cryptocurrency's "server share". You don't actually need mining to have blockchain technology, and without mining it doesn't matter how many entities own those X amount of servers, just that it's distributed among a lot of them. Compare this to a distributed database, the blockchain always checks against the full blockchain network instead of just 1 database. If a malicious user finds the database used for replication purposes and modifies the information there, it will eventually replicated across the server farm with that malicious change. While the blockchain will go "Well, there's this 1 server that says X, but there's (Total-1) servers saying Y, so let's go with Y.""

The papers published after this research also mark the first appearance of the expression brain–computer interface in scientific literature.The field of BCI research and development has since focused primarily on neuroprosthetics applications that aim at restoring damaged hearing, sight and movement.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

e4pyw89;deadbunny;1535092450.0;"You are correct. A single entity in charge of a Blockchain (either with coins/tokens or hashrate) has zero value over a regular database."
e4q8xf3;g-BANGA;1535102795.0;"This scenario  is not a distributed ledger. It google putting 2000 servers and managing a database for you. Your trusting google reputation that the transaction is correct. Its googles word that that house information is correct. A true public blockchain would be putting trust in the network its self. Which in itself gives it value. This is what gives the token value.Your understanding of the blockchain as a protocol is correct. In your google chain scenario it would't need a token. Its like the google releasing google $ and paying them selves in google $ to do transaction on it own network.What would stop someone from spamming the network and slowing if it was free to use? Why would a company want to be entrusted with a network with no value or token?"
e4qm273;BC1721;1535118530.0;"A. I had no idea what any of those words meant until I looked it up.B. I now read up on it, isn't dpos with elected parties instead of at random? Doesn't that put a target on their back? If you want to commit fraud and it's at random you need to control an extremely large amount of the parties *and* get lucky that the random verifiers are yours. If there's elected verifiers, you only need to control them and since they are elected, it's possible people find out who they are. It seems to me that that system would be constantly under attack, moreso than the random one.Again, not an expert. "

After the internet technology was made publicly available, real companies with shareholders and actual products emerged, even during the dot com bubble.Bitcoin is an ecological catastrophy on top of being difficult to use for the average person, wallets are trash even ten years after its inception. Using it as a *currency* makes no sense either.But the huge waste of energy of Proof-of-Work is a deal breaker alone."
e4pjvtm;Darius510;1535079397.0;"The whole point of it is that it isn't reliant on companies or institutions to begin with, so you're missing the point with that analogy. But there are plenty of companies that are interacting and building businesses on top of it - the reason they're generally not publicly traded is because they haven't needed to be when they're flush with private investment and capital from the crypto boom itself. Coinbase and Circle don't need to sell stock yet.It's energy intensive but in terms of where that energy comes from, it's probably one of the cleanest industries in terms of % usage of clean energy. The most profitable bitcoin mining operations are utilizing excess energy from hydropower and geothermal that wasn't being used anyway. There's still plenty of coal being burned to mine it for now, but they won't be able to compete long term, they're just going to get priced out of the game once it stops appreciating in price long term. Energy consumption isn't an issue if its clean energy, and by fully utilizing the excess capacity of clean energy resources it makes it cheaper for everyone else. A hydropower plant that can only sell 30% of the energy production capacity to non-miners has the same overhead costs as one that can sell 100% of it's energy capacity. That reduces the amount of that overhead that the general public needs to pay. No matter how cheap coal is it can't compete with excess hydropower that can always be cheaper."

The constant need for verification makes the network slow, virtually unscalable unless for some tricks to get around it, with new limitations for themselves.The companies you mentioned make money trading crypto, where are all the applications outside literal gambling?On top of that, to be traded, to use a wallet, to create new add-ons on the bitcoin blockchain it relies on companies and third-parties so please spare me the "trusless" talk.There is a huge opportunity cost using that money for a network that doesn't work and will never be able to be used as a currency, with Proof-of-Work. That energy can be put to better use and in a more cost efficient endeavour.>The most profitable bitcoin mining operations are utilizing excess energy from hydropower and geothermal that wasn't being used anywayEven with the opportunity cost I already mentioned, this is avoiding the question of all the pollution generated by all the other farms, subsidized by the cheap Chinese eletricity most of the time.Also, it won't ever become a global currency because it doesn't pass the regular sanity check of a currency in economics terms and doesn't allow for monetary policy in any way."

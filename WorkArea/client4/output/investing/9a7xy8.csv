9a7xy8;cpayne_10;1535242619.0;"I’ve set up a portfolio with just a mission to see how I perform against the market, and to see what mistakes I make and what I can do to improve on them. I’m very young with not that much capital so this isn’t a big deal to me. I just wanted to see how you guys fair against the market. I’ve been doing this for around a month and am currently down around 0.5% compared to the market. "

e4teixv;skuggic;1535243812.0;"So far my annual returns are 5.87% vs the S&P500's 7.50%, so I'm under-performing by 1.63%.I was over-performing throughout the year, but my biggest position is in Facebook which dropped by 20% after the last earnings report. I'm optimistic that they will recover by the end of the year though.Plus I have more than a third of my investing money in cash. If I had invested all of it I would be slightly outperforming the market this year despite the FB crash.I've been buying some Chinese stocks and ETFs in the past few weeks given that the Yuan is weak and the stocks are in a bear market despite performing very well. I think these investments will help me outperform in the coming years."

e4tnoog;rjm101;1535252816.0;"I find it quite difficult to know if I'm outperforming the market or not  aside from the bunch of dealing accounts I have. For example I have a stock portfolio several years old. Throughout each of these years I contributed more to the portfolio and each contribution weighs down on my overall profit due to the increased allocation of cash. I could compare the performance of the S&P 500 throughout these years but this would only work for those with portfolios that had an initial lump sum and didn't contribute more over time. Am I overcomplicating this? Is there a simple way? Are people just looking at the profit % and age of the dealing account and comparing the S&P 500 performance over these years?

And a few I was basically the same. Part of it is luck, part is spending more time researching before buying into something than used to. The last is not taking crazy risks. No penny stocks, no options. "

I'm eyeballing it from the Personal Capital charts, and this understates my performance as I sell winners (rare) and buy losers (all it does is backtest your current holdings). Even in that case I've outperformed the market on this chart by almost 10% since January 2017.Of course it does help to be heavily concentrated in AAPL and V.EDIT: Equity only, long only (except for two shorts a couple years ago that were bad ideas), no leverage."

Actually considering selling a bunch of positions only because I might buy a commercial building in the next year. Are there any other fidelity users?

Similarly to Warren Buffet, I only buy mostly financial stocks that I believe are under valued.​Some of my best trades have been buying stocks trading below book value.Word of advice for a newcomer: Remember that your not in the business of fortune telling, your in the business of buying businesses. You want to buy companies that RIGHT NOW are under valued. If a company has a book value of 1b$ and is trading for 700 mill$, and revenues/profit are steady, you've basically bought 1$ for 70 cents. ​I've found these opportunities are usually in mid-cap stocks trading with a few hundred million or 1-2 billion market cap, but occasionally even a large cap stock presents itself as a good opportunity.&#x200B;&#x200B;"

I added money to my account (on average) 3x a month. the past year has my original balance plus $ each time I add more. It is hard to compare as I have money in my account for 3 days (I bought some McDonalds this past week). If I look at my year chart it is acting as if I had that money in there since the start."

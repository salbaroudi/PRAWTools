9aofo8;ms1519;1535401054.0;Opening and Closing Two Brokerages In a Short Amount of Time
9aofo8;ms1519;1535401054.0;"Long story short, I opened a Robinhood account in March and used it for a while but didn't like it. Probably made about 50 trades. Then, I withdrew all the money and moved over to M1 Finance where I had about 80 holdings in all of my pies. I haven't sold any holdings, have just been accumulating them. I have found that I don't really like their setup either and would like to move to Fidelity where I have my Roth IRA. I regret not doing that initially, but I've learned my lesson. How complicated will it make my tax situation if I switch over to Fidelity at this point considering the amount of trades. Or is it as simple as just switching over? Any words of advice would be appreciated. Thanks a lot!"

And you’ll be charged a fee from the sending brokerage.Or you can just sell everything, transfer to your checking account and fund your fidelity account that way. You might not have that much taxes if you opened your current account recently and/or have insignificant gains."
e4wum5k;ServerOfJustice;1535401186.0;"There are no tax implications from switching brokers, only from selling your securities. I can’t imagine M1 or Robinhood allow you to buy anything that can’t be transferred to Fidelity in kind. "

e4ww8bv;ms1519;1535403257.0;"Thanks for the comment. I will just liquidate to my checking account and then fund fidelity. I think its a $100 to transfer outgoing from M1. "
e4ww937;ms1519;1535403284.0;"That's what I thought but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Thanks"
e4xfvkf;ms1519;1535421621.0;"It appears it would work well for long term investing if you don’t plan on changing your holdings. Nothing major turned me away from them, and they seem to be up and coming. I just prefer Fidelity because I’m used to how it is set up and will only be using ETFs that are commission free on Fidelity anyway. "

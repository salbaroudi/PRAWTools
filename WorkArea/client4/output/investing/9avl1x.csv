9avl1x;nickmerl;1535456191.0;"So I just read that federal bonds are tax free at the state level and I'm confused.  If I were to by a broad market bond etf(e.g. schz), would I be taxed on the distributions at the state level?"

e4yj8bc;ChekovsWorm;1535460488.0;"A broad market bond fund like SCHZ, AGG, BND, has a lot of corporate bonds in it, along with mortgage bonds - many of those which are considered "government bonds" because they are from the Government Sponsored Entities created by Congress like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (Not guaranteed by the government, but still people think they are and We The People did bail them out in the financial crisis but likely won't again. There are also a few mortgage bonds that are truly US guaranteed, from GNMA, VA, USDA mortgages.)None of the dividends from those are tax exempt at any level. Regardless of corporate, GSE non-guaranteed (Fannie, Freddie) or GSE guaranteed (Ginnie Mae etc.)A broad / aggregate bond fund like those also will have some amount of US Treasury bonds in it too. Dividends from those are exempt from state income tax but are federally taxable. It also will have some municipal bonds in it. That's in a way the converse of the Treasuries situation: Munis are normally not taxable at the federal level and usually not at the same-state level, but may be taxable at your state level if they aren't from your own state, or in some cases even if they are. But check your tax advisor or tax software or do some research, because things can vary around other-state taxation. And for high earners some muni bonds can be federally taxable under the AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax.)At year end, fund companies normally send out a statement or post on their websites what percentage of dividends paid by a bond fund are in fact tax-exempt from being from US Treasuries. And for munis, what state they were from. But elsewhere they're reporting that the fund overall paid X amount of dividends. You have some math to do at tax time to allocate and then on your return indicate what amount of dividend was tax exempt. Also there can be capital gains within the bond fund, but if it's an ETF that's quite unlikely. Finally you can yourself have capital gains or losses from sales of shares.Nothing that decent tax software can't handle, as long as you have the report, or if from a good brokerage, the download, of the tax info from the fund and overall account. And a general idea of what is and isn't taxable."

e4yr5m3;hydrocyanide;1535475574.0;"Municipal bonds are not included in SCHZ / AGG / BND because they are not part of the index, and they're excluded from the index exactly because of the tax complexity."
e4yudsh;ChekovsWorm;1535482370.0;"Thanks for the correction. I've seen some kind of total bond fund that did include some but must have been some other broader index or maybe an active fund."

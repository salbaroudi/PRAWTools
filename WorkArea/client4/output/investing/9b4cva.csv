9b4cva;gradientRub;1535530755.0;"Hi, I am just doing a math calculation to compare landlording/rental vs investing in stocks. Below is a calculation and can someone find an error here? Looks like landlording has higher IRR than stocks? I am not sharing the entire worksheet, but below the gist: 1. the "expenses" incurred during landlording are the ones invested in the "stocks" scenario. 2. In the landlording table, the numbers are the "cash flow". So, initially the numbers change as the years go by.3. I have included maintenance, depreciation and also that the landlord invests the cashflow if it is >0$. It is not apparent. Edit:I am not getting into landlording, but want to just simulate one example. Setting aside the issue of "managing people", does it sound right? IRR being higher for landlording.

e50b467;Boomslang114;1535532260.0;"I’ve done both and can say I’d rather manage money. It’s hard to part with a rate of return that is consistent and outpaces the market but dealing with people no matter how well you get them can be tiresome. If you think you can avoid paying an investment adviser playing the market is the smarter move. "
e50btt3;Willsturd;1535532945.0;"Did you factor in depreciation costs and other expenses. A good rule of thumb is to budget 1% of the total cost of the home. So if your home is 400,000 then maintenance costs could be $4,000 a year which would almost make up 17% of monthly rent.Will vary tremendously with the quality of house.Also you should multiply the resulting rent with the realistic occupancy rate in that area. If you're perceived occupancy rate is 90%, then its another 10% decrease to your rent.Also there's mortgage insurance depending on your credit and down payment.Lastly you should factor in your time and energy. If you can spend it  on this house for 30 years. Else you would need to hire a management company which would eat another 10% of the total rent.Crunch the numbers after all that and if the IRR is still higher then landlording could indeed be better than stocks."

e50cl5j;JJ742653;1535533667.0;"While the math on the IRR might favor landlording, a few more things to consider might be the potential for the property to appreciate, for property taxes to increase, the effects of inflation, and the potential income/capital gains tax implications (yearly rental income being taxed at your income tax rate vs. stocks taxed at your capital gains rate).  Outside of IRR I think one should consider the different forms of risk of each investment to decide which would be best for him or her.  I would be curious to make a calculation of the above factors."

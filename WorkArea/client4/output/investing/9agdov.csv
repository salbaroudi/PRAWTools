For that MEX would be saying “shut up and take my money!” pretty hard. It becomes a TRIFECTA for Trump because he also ends up seriously fucking California (big Democrat state), AND now gets to brow-beat Canada for being “mean” and “unfriendly” for dragging out the negotiations, AND shows him becoming best friends again with Mexico for their strong partnership in fighting illegal immigration, which brings the biggest number of people voting trump next election (Latino vote) solidly back onto his side—again fucking Democrats... that’s some serious 4D chess!Maybe the reason Canada won’t sign is that they want the US to pay for building a wall between USA/CANADA.

e4viwwe;cuteman;1535338323.0;"China invests in Canada and Mexico to sidestep tariffs from China to the US directly. That whole steel from Canada argument? Yeah China dumps steel from China, in through Canada, who sells into the US.The narrative is that we are attacking allies but really the US is annoyed Canada has become a conduit for China. Ipso facto you have China benefitting from NAFTA more than the NA countries.Mexico and the US are at the table now because Mexico is practically cheaper than China nowadays for production. They're also where China has put their most recent investments.Canada will only be invited to the table as a junior partner, not as NAFTA currently stands. "
e4vf0tf;deadjawa;1535334511.0;"We don’t know what’s in it.  What we do know is that the new president of Mexico is a leftist who will push for nationalizations in the oil industry.  So it’s quite likely there are restrictions in the deal that will protect both American and PEMEX energy interests.There’s also likely some draconian restrictions on auto manufacturing because trump thinks assembling cars is still a high paying job that will help Americans.  It’s unlikely to me that there’s any real economic breakthrough in this package because trump has shown he doesn’t know what an economic breakthrough really is.  But at a minimum it will probably protect the status quo which is a market positive."
e4vf290;RVA2DC;1535334550.0;"> The U.S. and Mexico in recent weeks had largely focused on the thorny issue of car manufacturing, as the Trump administration pushes for a deal that would boost factory jobs in America. The U.S. has proposed tightening regional content requirements for car production and having a certain percentage of a car manufactured by higher-paid workers.What part of this is specifically good for the stock market? Losing access to lower-cost production? Increased manufacturing costs via higher-paid workers? I guess I don’t see how this boosts the stock market. "

e4vo15u;Bopshidowywopbop;1535343201.0;"I work in the steel industry in Canada specifically pipe. There are already normal values against Chinese pipe manufacturers so they do not out compete Canadian manufacturers. There’s actually normal values set for almost every country that imports steel pipe in to Canada. The manufacturers who have operations in Canada (Evraz (Russian owned), Tenaris (Argentinian owned) and Welded Tube of Canada (not sure who owns them)) pushed for these tariffs to keep the market up so they can keep employing Canadians. Turns out labour costs a lot more in North American than in India and China etc. Now to the point of Canada as a cheap conduit of steel. My company imports a lot of Chinese pipe that we cannot sell in to US because when ever you are shipping something across a border you need to prove it’s origin. You will have the same tariffs against Chinese steel moving in to US from Canada as you would if it came directly from China. That being said, I did hear that when the Cheeto initially put up the steel tariffs and Canada was exempt Evraz was selling their hot roll coil (HRC) in the US (because who wouldn’t, the market price shot up) and then was producing pipe with cheaper Chinese HRC. This technically would be a Canadian product because it was ‘produced’ in Canada to which Evraz could ship to the US at that time. However since then Canadian steel products are facing  tariffs going in to the US too. In reaction Canada is currently in the middle of an investigation and will most likely putting some industry wide anti-dumping measures in place so the Canadian steel market doesn’t bottom out. I work for an importer and I still think there should be protections put in place because we need a domestic steel industry.Just my 2 cents from the pipe side of things. I’d be interested to see if anyone else has perspectives from different sides of the steel industry. "

"
e4voulg;Bopshidowywopbop;1535343970.0;"Actually it’s a little bit more complicated than that. Chinese mills are able to produce steel products to American standards pretty easily and CHEAPLY. It’s not actually like it’s rocket science. Chinese labour is ridiculously cheap so it helps a lot for the finished cost of the product. It’s not a question if the US wants to produce more steel, it’s a question of whether American industry wants to pay the higher cost for American steel. Obviously they don’t with manufacturers shutting down left right and center (maybe not steel related but Harley Davidson is a good example of this). There wouldn’t be anti-dumping measures put in place if nobody wanted to buy ‘low quality’ Chinese steel. The quality is fine, that’s why people want to buy it. "

Steel manufactured in China doesn't have a very good quality assurance and quality control process. Often lower grade steel can be "accidentally" switched with higher grade steel and it has caused huge problems in the past.  Anecdotally, one of my first jobs was as a quality control tech for a Chinese automotive glass company here in America. They would constantly bend the rules and fudge numbers and ship it to our customers like Chrysler and Volkswagen. One time I called glass out for a whole 12 hour shift because of distortion in the glass measured at like a 12° refraction index (really really bad). Chinese higher ups came into the lab and basically just made me stand there and keep running the same test on the same piece of glass until I called it in specification before I could go home. After 2 hours after my shift ended I was fed up and just cleared it for shipment and left my real report on my boss' desk so I could go home and sleep. "

Also, you do understand that Chinese people do get educated in the US and then go back to China right? That's not even the point. Materials science is complicated, but to think only Americans can do it is stupid. The most advanced steel manufacturers are in Germany and Japan.

They will pay a premium to have valve castings produced in the UK, Italy, Germany, or even select places in India over China.   Once again, it's not a knowledge gap but a trust issue.
